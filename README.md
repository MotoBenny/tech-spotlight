# Tech Spotlight

## Project Description

Welcome to Tech Spotlight. The goal of this project is to search through relevant job postings and find the frequency of technologies associated with those jobs.

This is achieved in two parts: a scraper that scrapes data off Indeed.com with four queries, job title, location, age of posting, and a number of jobs to scrape. This produces a CSV file which can be processed within a  Kaggle notebook, that tells the story about what technologies, frameworks, and libraries were found and how frequently they were posted.

Enabling and user to get hyper focused insights about the job market and they are interested in, as it pertains to software development
