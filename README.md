# Tech Spotlight

## Project Description

Welcome to Tech Spotlight. The goal of this project is to search through relevant job postings and find the frequency of technologies associated with those jobs.

This is achieved in two parts: a scraper that scrapes data off Indeed.com with three queries, location, age of posting and number of postings and a Kaggle notebook that tells the story about what technologies, frameworks and libraries were found and how frequently they were posted.
