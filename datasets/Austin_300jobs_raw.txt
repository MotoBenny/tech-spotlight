Whether you are working on projects internally or for a client, software development is critical to the success of IBM and our clients worldwide. At IBM, you will use the latest software development tools, techniques and approaches and work with leading minds in the industry to build solutions you can be proud of.
   

Your Role and Responsibilities
 Are you interested in pursuing a software development career? Have you heard about agile development, but want to learn more about how it ‘works’? Are you someone that has a foundational understanding of development or programming concepts, but want to take a less traditional path to achieve it?
   


What is an Apprenticeship?
 IBM Apprenticeship Program, which lasts approximately 12 months, is an official registered apprenticeship recognized by the Department of Labor (DOL). Every graduate of a Registered Apprenticeship program receives a nationally-recognized credential from the DOL.
   
 During the apprenticeship duration, you will be required to complete specific learning hours and on the job training that has been outlined to ensure you are developing the skills and competencies essential to the role. You will be able to learn and grow at your own pace, but we expect most apprentices will complete their learning within 12 months. Once you graduate and receive your certificate from our apprentice program, you will be eligible to apply to available full-time roles at IBM. 
   

Who you Are
 An apprenticeship is about learning. We’re seeking candidates who have the following requirements, but we know you’re just getting your career started, and we’re committed to helping you learn and grow. If you’ve had some experience with coding or development in the past, you’re exactly the type of candidate we’re looking for….

 Design Thinking
 Hypothesis driven development
 Social coding
 Agile principles
 Container development using tools such as Docker or Vagrant
 Application Development, DevOps automation, and the development toolchain (e.g. Travis, Jenkins, Junit, automated test tools)



What’s the Experience? 
 As an apprentice, you'll join with other apprentices in a local cohort. You'll go through your first few weeks together, learning about IBM and the skills you'll be attaining throughout your apprenticeship. Then, you'll work with your managers and mentors to progress through your personal skills roadmap, learning and demonstrating new knowledge and competencies through hands-on application with your project teams. You'll complete milestones along the way, earning digital credentials to validate your skills, and will come back together with other apprentices to participate in on-going training and development focused on your professional and technical skills.
   
 As a Software Engineer Apprentice at IBM, you’ll work as part of a larger team of experienced developers and mentors in an interactive, collaborative environment. You’ll learn the fundamentals of development, software design, testing, and cloud computing, agile principles, IBM Design Thinking, DevOps and continuous delivery. You will also learn how to resolve IBM customer issues, debug customer problems and environments, and increase Cloud Service skills, and will build the skills to grow your career as a Software Developer. Best of all, you are a contributing member of your team, putting forward ideas, taking on responsibilities and making choices about how you get the job done just like any other IBMer.

Status: Full-time


 Company background:
 As a pioneer in virtual reality gaming systems, Virtuix Inc. continues to break ground with cutting-edge VR technologies. Virtuix has created two entertainment products that have become global hits: Omni Pro, the commercial version of the Omni, and Omni Arena, a multiplayer configuration for Family Entertainment Centers like Dave and Buster’s. Thanks to the Omni’s popularity at over 500 venues on 5 continents, we have built a large and devoted player community (2 million plays… and counting).  In response to demand from Omni fans, we are now developing “Omni One,” a consumer version of the Omni that’s optimized for home use – light, easy to store, and with unmatched freedom of movement (incl. crouching and jumping). Omni One is a complete gaming platform. Its online game store sells games developed by Virtuix and top titles licensed from third parties.  Learn more about Omni One here: https://omni.virtuix.com  The thrill of walking around inside video games has blown the minds of players at our commercial venues. We plan to take our success in commercial entertainment and scale it into the home. Join our mission to launch Omni One and bring our popular gaming experience to millions of homes around the world.



 Job description:
 The Virtuix team is looking for a full-time Game Developer at our Austin, TX headquarters to develop and maintain first-party games for the Omni entertainment platform.  As a Game Developer at Virtuix, you will work semi-autonomously, creating games from concept to release with minimal assistance. Our games are made primarily in Unreal Engine 4, so you must have experience working in the UE4 engine and you must be proficient in game design, level design, and blueprint scripting.



 Responsibilities:

 Drive gameplay systems and content design through all development phases, from concept to release (including but not limited to characters, weapons, scoring, AI logic)

 Create levels from start to finish (block out prototype, set dressing, lighting, etc.)

 Keep existing content up-to-date and compatible with the latest hardware and software

 Frequently test game builds to ensure that the builds meet our quality standard

 Improve games based on customer feedback

 Familiarity with current virtual reality systems and games

 We offer:

 Competitive compensation package

 Virtuix stock options

 Health, dental, vision, and life insurance

 Open vacation policy

 Paid maternity and paternity leave

 Fully stocked kitchen



 More about Virtuix:
 Moving around virtual worlds by pushing buttons on a controller feels unnatural and static. To experience true VR, you need to walk around virtual worlds as you do in real life – using your own feet. That’s why we developed “Omni.”  Backed by over $35MM from investors, including Mark Cuban and 12 venture capital funds, Virtuix’s Omni is the first omni-directional treadmill that lets players walk and run in 360 degrees inside VR games and other virtual worlds. The Omni’s immersive experience takes VR to the next level. The system was even portrayed in Steven Spielberg’s Ready Player One.  Omni Pro, the commercial version, and Omni Arena, a multiplayer configuration, have become global entertainment hits. We’ve shipped over 4,000 systems to 45 countries, including to major venues like Dave & Buster’s.  In response to demand from Omni fans, we began developing “Omni One,” a consumer version that’s optimized for home use.  Watch this video about our company’s achievements to date and future product roadmap:    Virtuix is blazing the market trail for ultimate immersive gaming. If working at the forefront of tech’s convergence with gaming excites you, then Virtuix is the place to be.  Please send a cover letter and your resume to cameron.slayter@virtuix.com.  Virtuix is an Equal Employment Opportunity Employer.

The Profiles Platform powers identity resolution and provides managed access to profiles data which will serve as the backbone to all Twilio Engage product efforts.

Twilio Engage is the brand new growth automation platform, built natively on Segment as the customer data platform (CDP) and natively on Twilio's communications APIs. Our vision is a unified platform that intelligently delivers the most relevant content to marketers through the best channel at every point in their lifecycle. Imagine a platform that can take the hundreds of thousands of messages entering Segment's pipelines every second, add in a new identity graph, and overlay multiple high speed, realtime and batch databases — and you have the Personas platform. We've since built several successful products on top of the Personas platform: Segment Audiences for real time audience management, Segment Traits for computation, and Profile API for real time personalization.

With the multi-channel customer data provided by segment we can add more intelligence to our customer engagement products by transforming raw customer data across all channels into actionable, individualized, machine-learning based customer predictions that marketers can use in any workflow or process.

In this role, you'll:
Solve complex distributed systems problems oriented around achieving reliable and cost effective message processing at high scale.

Both internal (your peers) and external clients commend your excellent communication skills and the timeliness of your follow-up skills.
You can work independently or in a team orientated environment.

 See yourself at Twilio

Join the team as our next Backend Software Engineer (L3).

Who we are & why we're hiring

Twilio powers real-time business communications and data solutions that help companies and developers worldwide build better applications and customer experiences.

Although we're headquartered in San Francisco, we have presence throughout South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. We're on a journey to becoming a globally anti-racist, anti-oppressive, anti-bias company that actively opposes racism and all forms of oppression and bias. At Twilio, we support diversity, equity & inclusion wherever we do business. We employ thousands of Twilions worldwide, and we're looking for more builders, creators, and visionaries to help fuel our growth momentum.

About the job

This position is needed to support Twilio Engage as a Backend Software Engineer.

As a Backend Developer in the Twilio Engage pillar, you'll have the opportunity to grow and evolve a young product family, but also to see the rapid adoption of your creation as Twilio Engage reaches new customers. The team is also growing fast, and you'll have the opportunity to help guide that growth.

We work primarily with Go, Kafka, and NodeJS. The core of the application is based on streaming data, so candidates will need to reason about both time-delayed events and distributed systems.

This product faces enterprise-scale usage already, despite being very early in its life cycle. Engineers must deal with scaling out existing backend tools, planning and designing new features to fit in with existing ones.

You will need to understand and articulate the trade-offs between new functionality and stability. You will need to persuade all involved to make the right architectural choices for the long-term technical health of the product.

Responsibilities

In this role, you'll:

Work with a collaborative team to brainstorm ideas, build new features, and scale out our platform.
Design engineering solutions, execute on projects, and debug complex systems and applications.
Review code, offer improvements to practices and processes to impact the team and larger organization.
Collaborate with cross-functional partners from Product, Design, and Engineering to deliver on projects and influence product roadmaps and sprints.
Put yourself in the customers' shoes by understanding how they use our products and advocating for solutions that represent their needs.
Cultivate a culture of empowerment and psychological safety.
Qualifications

Not all applicants will have skills that match a job description exactly. Twilio values diverse experiences in other industries, and we encourage everyone who meets the required qualifications to apply. While having "desired" qualifications make for a strong candidate, we encourage applicants with alternative experiences to also apply. If your career is just starting or hasn't followed a traditional path, don't let that stop you from considering Twilio. We are always looking for people who will bring something new to the table!

Required:

3+ years of industry experience.
Strong engineering fundamentals, with fluency in languages such as NodeJS, Go.
Experience designing, developing, and operating services in cloud-deployed environments.
Exposure to SDLC from reviewing requirements to debugging complex systems in production.

Desired:

Bachelor's and/or Master's degree, preferably in Computer Science, or equivalent experience.
Experience building API products with frameworks such as REST and GraphQL.
Fluency in Kafka and Go, or related technologies.
Location

This role will be based in the US as a remote position. No travel is required.

What We Offer

There are many benefits to working at Twilio, including, in addition to competitive pay, things like generous time-off, ample parental and wellness leave, healthcare, a retirement savings program, and much more. Offerings vary by location.

Twilio thinks big. Do you?

We like to solve problems, take initiative, pitch in when needed, and are always up for trying new things. That's why we seek out colleagues who embody our values — something we call Twilio Magic. Additionally, we empower employees to build positive change in their communities by supporting their volunteering and donation efforts.

So, if you're ready to unleash your full potential, do your best work, and be the best version of yourself, apply now!

If this role isn't what you're looking for, please consider other open positions.

Colorado applicants:

The estimated pay range for this role, based in Colorado, is $132,320 - $165,400.
Additionally, this role is eligible to participate in Twilio's equity plan.

The successful candidate's starting salary will be determined based on permissible, non-discriminatory factors such as skills, experience, and geographic location within the state. This role is also eligible to participate in Twilio's equity plan and for the following benefits: health care insurance, 401(k) retirement account, paid sick time, paid personal time off, paid parental leave.

Athenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here's the deal - we don't store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

We accomplish this using state of the art technology and engineering to make it happen, with consideration for the customer as the center of all that we do.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV.


We have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2014 in the UK and 2002 worldwide.

Technologies come and go, but that excites you because of the endless possibilities it creates. You are looking for an opportunity to work for a company whose software is utilized by every Fortune 500 company and significantly impacts every industry. You want to be a part of a collaborative environment whose teams care about the product they are creating, how they create it, and the impact it has on customers’ business objectives.

 What is primary need, technical challenge, and/or problem you will be responsible for? 
Our microservices engineering team is responsible for the architecture, design, and implementation of common services for our new platform. The CloudHealth platform manages data from multiple cloud providers in support of our 10,000+ customers. Our microservices team is developing a scalable platform to be consumed by our customers, partners, integrators, and CloudHealth feature engineering teams.
 This team is leveraging the latest technologies to build reusable core services and a data pipeline that must be secure, scalable, reliable, available, and performant. If you are great at solving scale and resiliency problems in a rapidly expanding 24/7 SaaS environment and thrive on the challenges of developing and deploying microservices, this is the team for you.
 Success in the Role: What are the performance goals over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing? 

You will be expected to produce software designs that define CloudHealth’s next generation service API and related infrastructure. These interfaces must meet VMware and industry standards and provide a consistent programming model across multiple programming languages. 
You will define and develop APIs (REST and graphQL), SDKs and CLI interfaces that offer a consistent and secure access point to the CloudHealth platform for both internal and external use cases. You will also deliver automated tests and documentation to support the adoption of these interfaces.
 You will be expected to work closely with other teams within CloudHealth that need to consume core platform features and ensure that their programmatic interface needs are met.
 You will be responsible for designing and delivering the supporting infrastructure functions to deliver your solutions at cloud-scale, including features such as usage tracking, throttling, monitoring and alerting.
 You will be regularly evaluated on the quality of the product you create and the code you write to ensure continued advancement of your technical skills in an environment that looks to expand them. 
As a member of the CloudHealth infrastructure group you will be expected to work with and contribute to its Kubernetes based microservices architecture, and all your deliverables must align with the group’s development and deployment standards.
 Advocate, encourage, and influence innovation and adoption of microservices architecture by being an effective technical leader across development teams.


 What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis? 
As a new member of the Infrastructure Platform Team (aka “Team Atlas”), you will:

 Design and develop software using a microservices architecture, with knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes, in leading cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) and build frameworks for other teams to follow your path
 Work with the team and product management to build delivery requirements
 Write technical design documents and hold reviews
 Participate in all team scrum ceremonies
 Develop and maintain software that delivers on the team’s objectives primarily in Java and Scala, and, infrequently, in Ruby or Golang
 Deploy microservices to Kubernetes using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) systems
 Participate in our on-call rotation, providing operational support to our platform
 Communicate with internal consumers of the team’s software and gather requirements and facilitate adoption of your solutions


 What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?
 This position reports to the Manager of the CloudHealth Platform Team (aka “Team Atlas”), an experienced software engineer and manager who joined CloudHealth as an engineer in 2017. The team consists of highly competent senior engineers. We focus on iterative development, both of software and our software development practices.
 You will initially be part an established team that has a wide range of core platform responsibilities, but the expectation is that you will help harden and evolve our Kubernetes-based development platform. This position is focused on making CloudHealth engineers more efficient by paving a path using components that our teams can use “off-the-shelf” to solve complex problems like CI/CD, inter-service communication, GraphQL API specifications, and others. This is a great opportunity to work with leading-edge technologies, experiment with new ways to build software, and provide critical supporting software to fellow engineers.

 This job may require the candidate to travel and/or work from a facility that requires full vaccination prior to entry.
