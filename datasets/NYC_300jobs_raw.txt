Job summary Come join the AWS Marketplace Team in our mission to change the way enterprise software are bought and sold!

We are looking for an experienced Software Development Engineer to help the team take AWS Marketplace to the next level. As a Senior Software Development Engineer on the team you will own significant portions of the product and will have significant influence on our strategy by helping define the next wave of product features and system architecture. The systems are complex and there are huge opportunities to work at all levels from the front end user experience, to a set of robust platform services, to system level pieces and everything in between.

Location: Full Time - Rochester, NY/Remote


    Measures for Justice is a non-partisan, fast-paced, entrepreneurial non-profit on a mission to make good criminal justice data available and actionable to spur reform. Since 2011, we have pioneered a methodology to compare how different justice systems perform on the county level and led the charge to improve county-level criminal justice data. While we do not advocate for any specific reforms, we do work to make change possible by increasing system transparency, accessibility, and accountability. We’ve got world-class criminal justice data and technology chops. And a culture that demands excellence, rigor and people who like to make good ideas come to life. 
   Our Premise


    Local communities and the institutions that serve them are in the best position to reshape how their criminal justice system works. 
   What Problem Is MFJ Trying to Solve?


    The data communities need to make informed decisions about system performance and change are in short supply. The same goes for accountability and transparency. As a result, communities and the institutions that serve them are not equipped to work together on lasting change.
  


 How Does MFJ Aim To Solve This Problem?


    We’ve developed a new model for the community and the prosecutor/police/courts to work together to create a space for making criminal justice data transparent and shared goals public via a public dashboard called Commons.
  

 The Job


    As a Web Developer, reporting to the Director of Product Engineering, you will work on an agile team of talented developers to create data-centric, web based products that help bring transparency to the criminal justice system and reflect MFJ’s social impact mission.
  

 What You Will Do


    You will be working in a full Javascript stack leveraging React, D3, Next.js, Node, Typescript and GraphQL and will be developing and supporting both public facing products as well as internally facing data processing tools. Our overall tech stack includes HTML5/CSS, React, Node, Next.js, D3, Kotlin, Java, Postgres, Docker, AWS services (including S3 and DynamoDB), Redis, GraphQL, Kubernetes.
  

 About You




      You are continually improving your craft and are eager to work with the latest technologies.
    


      You have strong design and critical thinking skills, with knowledge of web development best practices.
    


      You are creative with an intuitive sense of design. You have a mastery of HTML5/CSS and can develop a UI without a framework, but have also worked with frameworks such as SASS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, or Foundation.
    


      Your programming skills are way above average, you’re admired by your peers and have had a continuous string of successful projects.
    


      You are familiar with accessibility best-practices. You write semantic HTML that can be navigated with just a keyboard, and you know when to use (and not use) ARIA attributes.
    


      You have worked with JavaScript libraries/environments such as React, Node, Next.js, D3,UI component libraries.
    


      You have prior professional experience working for a criminal justice agency (preferred).
    


      1+ years professional web development experience (Co-ops and Internships apply).
    


      BS or MS in Computer Science or related discipline or an equivalent combination of education and experience.
    


 Next Steps


    To apply, please visit our website - https://www.measuresforjustice.org/about/jobs
  


 Review of applications will begin 
   immediately

Who we are
 At Path we believe behavioral health should be treated with the same respect, rigor, and focus of other chronic diseases. We're building the future of mental health, and in 20 years we'll look back and be astounded that we ever treated the physical before the mental.
 What we're solving
 Over 65 million Americans suffer from a treatable mental health issue - that's 1 out of every 5 people. Today it's difficult to find a provider, and for those with complicated conditions, it's nearly impossible to find coordinated care. We're here to fix this.
 How we're solving
 Path is at the intersection of tech + mental health with thousands of therapists, psychiatrists, and other mental health services delivering care through a virtual first approach. Our platform matches patients with exactly the right person for their needs, whether it's experience with a certain condition, gender, race, location, life experience, etc.

 Role Overview
 As a member of Path's Engineering team, you'll be able to focus on doing your best work and create a real impact with a team of like-minded people who waste minimal time on unnecessary overhead. While we're looking for software engineers of all levels of seniority, we're excited by candidates who enjoy and are capable of working on a small team with a fast-growing product. We're looking for generalists who can work across the stack and those who gravitate towards frontend, backend, or infrastructure engineering. We recognize people are passionate about different areas and you'll have the option to be involved in as much (or as little) as you'd like.
 Today we build products for 2 primary customers; patients and therapists:
 On the patient side, we're focused on a fast and delightful enrollment where patients can find a therapist that's right for them and who takes their insurance in less than 10 minutes.
 On the therapist side, we're building a full set of practice management software including patient recruiting, scheduling, patient notes, referrals, and more. Our therapists spend all day in Path and their experience needs to be fantastic.
 This is a really unique opportunity to help build on the foundational engineering infrastructure at a company where the business is already humming and we have thousands of users every day. If this sounds exciting and energizing, we'd love to talk!
 Technical Stack
 Path's systems are written in Ruby on Rails, with React frontends. We use Postgres for our databases and everything is hosted on AWS. We also make heavy use of existing tools like Salesforce, Airtable, Typeform, etc. This has enabled us to scale very quickly with a small team but we're now ready to bring much of this work in-house. We're standing up the technical foundation that will power the future of the company. It doesn't matter if you don't have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, we'd still love to connect with you!
 What You'll Be Doing
 As an engineer at Path, you'll have endless opportunities to help build, shape, and lay the tracks for future technical infrastructure, and provide input on product, design, and cultural decisions, if that interests you.
 In this role, you will:

Spend most of your time writing code. We are a small team with minimal overhead and you'll spend the vast majority of your day actually writing code.
Build, test, and deploy software in a continuous manner (we deploy throughout the week, if not every day)
Work across the company to shape the future of the engineering organization. We are getting started and if there's a topic you're passionate about like recruiting, deployment, infrastructure, tools, etc., we're excited for you to contribute.
Actively shape the product direction by participating in product reviews, design reviews, and customer research.
Create and contribute to technical specs and testing/rollout plans.
Work with external and internal stakeholders to ensure we're solving the right problems.
Mentor and sponsor your teammates to help them grow.

What We're Looking For
 Even if you don't have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, we'd love to talk to you! An ideal candidate would be someone with the following traits:

Self-managed work-ethic. We are building a highly focused, low overhead team and trust people to get their work done on their own initiative
Shipped customer-focused software at scale
Problem solvers, people who are going to be able to spot problems in existing systems and/or people who come with a solution-oriented approach
Working experience from a technology company or technology startup
Collaborative working style, success working across functions
Clear and concise written, verbal, and technical communication skills
Experience writing well-structured, well-tested, and maintainable code
Demonstrated ability to mentor and teach others



 Our Team
 Path is a respectful, upbeat, and remote-first team united by our mission of simplifying behavioral healthcare services. We want our employees to be themselves and celebrate each other's differences. We trust our employees to do what's best for patients and our fellow team members without bureaucracy. We prioritize self-care and are building a sustainable business for the long term.
 As Part Of Our Team, Full-Time Employees Receive

The ability to work from wherever you want within the US
Competitive pay and benefits that don't change based on your location
2 company-wide shutdown weeks each year to focus on self-care
Paid parental leave to support you and your family
Medical, dental, and vision insurance through our employer plan
Access to our 401K
Access to an Employer Assistance Plan (EAP) through our insurance plan
The equipment you need to ensure your home office sets you up for success

 Block Renovation Software Engineer

ABOUT US

Block is a renovation platform transforming the $450 billion renovation industry. Block democratizes access to high-end design, while combining design, construction, and materials into a streamlined experience. Block simplifies a complex and convoluted process and gives homeowners certainty on outcomes, quality, price, and time.

Our mission is to give homeowners a better way to improve the spaces they live in, and to give contractors a better way to work. We are building an ambitious, tenacious, and creative team who is unafraid of tackling new challenges. The founders are former leaders at Casper, HuffPost, and Rent the Runway. Investors include Softbank, New Enterprise Associates, Lerer Hippeau, Giant Ventures, Obvious Ventures, MorningSide Ventures and more.

Employees come to Block for the opportunity to work in a rapidly scaling tech start-up that remains steadfastly dedicated to its employees, its culture, and constant iteration and improvement.

Learn more about the platform we’re building here.

ROLE

We are building an ambitious technical organization and looking for software engineers across backend, frontend, and full-stack to contribute to our mission.

You will work with our engineering and product teams in a low-debt, high-velocity environment to develop our home renovation and contractor platform.

As an early contributor, you will help contribute to key decisions about the technologies, tools, and best practices we adopt into our engineering culture. You will deliver the best experience possible for our clients while ensuring high standards of code quality. Your work will make a tangible impact on the lives of design and construction professionals along with people and their homes.

Learn more about our tech stack here.

We have three cross functional product development squads: Growth, Scope and FX.

The Growth Squad focuses on the initial experience homeowners have with our platform - from helping them visualize their new spaces to scheduling their initial calls with Block Project Planners.

The Scope Squad focuses on the interdependencies between labor, materials and costs. They help our platform get smarter and better understand the complexities and intricacies of a renovation to keep things simple for homeowners and contractors. They also build tools to help with supply chain and logistics challenges to ensure the right materials arrive on the jobs sites at the right time.

The Efficiency and Experience Squad - FX for short - focuses on the lead-up to construction, schedule and task management, and communication between homeowners and contractors.

Some products you could work on:

Visual Planner - a responsive web app for playing with different finish materials and visualizing them in real-time renders.
Digital Scope Engine - an intelligence rule engine for managing the labor scope and materials for a renovation project, as well as the associate pricing model.
Builder App - the core of the technology experience for our network of General Contractors. From the app, GCs accept new projects, manage timelines, communicate with homeowners and keep track of the success of their business on the Block platform.
Customer Dashboard - the platform where homeowners see progress on their renovation project and take action to drive it forward. Starting with the planning stage of their project, through preparing to break ground, and finally while the finishing touches are put on their space, the dashboard gives our customers a real-time view into everything happening in their space.

Some challenges you can help us solve:

How can we learn a homeowner’s tastes in a fun way and use that knowledge to significantly reduce the time spent designing a space?
How can we leverage experience from hundreds of past projects to solve construction challenges that pop up during design and in the field?
How can we help GCs build their businesses and spend less time dealing with administrative work?
How can we reliably and quickly get compatible building materials to job sites?

Our award-winning support teams help businesses around the world solve complex communications challenges every day.

At Bandwidth, your music matters when you are part of the BAND. We celebrate differences and encourage BANDmates to be their authentic selves. #jointheband

Our Hiring Team Mission

On the Emergency Voice Services (EVS) team, our mission is to be a global leader in 911 services by executing innovative solutions to connect users to emergency services with fast, reliable, accurate 911 services. To sum it up, our mission is purposeful because we save lives for a living.

What We Need

We're looking for a Software Engineer who gets things done and is capable of being a leader on our EVS software development team. We're seeking somebody who is a maker, a hacker, and a software craftsman. If your idea of fun is losing track of time while geeking out over a new technology, we'd like to talk to you.

What You'll Do

You're gonna write great code and lots of it.
You'll be a member of an agile software development team, and a leading voice in your team's design and implementation efforts.
You'll collaborate with peers to build and refactor code that is both readable and reliable due to its inherent lack of complexity.
You'll also look critically at what we're building and how we're building it, and you'll originate ideas and activities that advance our craft.

What You'll Need

If you're our person, you probably look like this:

You have expertise in Java and the Java technology ecosystem
You're passionate about writing testable code, and your non-complex test automation proves it
You're a student of software craftsmanship, always looking for new and better ways to build things
You have experience building web services
You understand network protocols, HTTP, and REST
You're familiar with relational and non-relational database systems
You have experience writing testable code and test automation patterns

Little Extra From You

Wow, it'd be really cool if:

You have experience with AWS or another cloud platform, and you "get" how scalable cloud applications are engineered
You have worked with Docker containers and Kubernetes

Are you excited about the position and its responsibilities, but not sure if you're 100% qualified? Do you feel you can work to help us crush the mission? If you answered 'yes' to both of these questions, we encourage you to apply! You won't want to miss the opportunity to be a part of the BAND.

Little Extra For You

At Bandwidth, we're pretty proud of our corporate culture, which is rooted in our "Whole Person Promise." We promise all employees that they can have meaningful work AND a full life, and we provide a work environment geared toward enriching your body, mind, and spirit. How do we do that? Well…

You're guaranteed to be given "work that matters." If you ain't feelin' that, let us know. We'll fix it.
Twice a year you can take a "sprint sabbatical" - 2 weeks to work on a project of your choosing, so long as you learn something along the way.
Your health insurance premiums are 100% paid by Bandwidth. So are your dental insurance premiums. So are your life insurance premiums. It's pretty nice.
When you're on vacation, nobody is allowed to contact you. No calls, texts, emails… Enjoy your time off.
We provide you with a gym membership, a lunchtime shuttle to the gym, and give you 90 minutes for lunch if you work out.

Each of these new services further increases the value of the network for our customers and the differentiation of the VMware solution.

 This is a role in the CTO team within SEBU. We work at the forefront of these new feature offerings, partnering with customers and our SEBU engineering team to develop early prototypes and new product innovation, as well as continuing to evolve our core SDWAN and SASE offerings to utilize the latest technologies to increase scale, performance, and reliability. This is a role focused on our software data plane, responsible for new feature prototyping and development, and cross product integration written mostly in C, with some work in Python. If you’re interested in working within a small, high performance team building new and innovative networking products, this is the team you want to join.

 Within one month of employment, you should expect to ramp up on the technical stacks and set up your dev environment. The projects we work on are early-stage concepts and thus challenging and fast moving, so expect to be thrown into feature development as soon as possible.
 Within six months of employment, you should expect to have developed features necessary for customer betas of the significant new features for the product.

Familiarity with a variety of networking control plane protocols is also useful, and experience with SD-WAN or other software-defined networking technologies is helpful. We develop on bare-metal hardware as well as virtualized environments, so familiarity with ESXi and KVM is desirable, and we also deploy in all the major cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP), so prior experience working on cloud-based development is preferred. You will take complete ownership of your tasks end-to-end which includes design, implementation, unit testing and deployment of the product/service.

 What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?
 The team will is a small, fast-moving advanced technologies team where you will work with other members of the SEBU CTO group, our SASE Engineering team, as well as partnering with other engineering teams across VMware, and potentially with external partners. As the team scales, you will be expected to become a domain expert in the area you own and be able to lead on the projects falling in your area of expertise. The team culture is challenging and fast paced, but with good people that are ready to help each other and support each other and be successful together. We have people from different backgrounds, and we believe a diverse team can help sparking innovation.

Investors include Softbank, New Enterprise Associates, Lerer Hippeau, Giant Ventures, Obvious Ventures, MorningSide Ventures and more.

Employees come to Block for the opportunity to work in a rapidly scaling tech start-up that remains steadfastly dedicated to its employees, its culture, and constant iteration and improvement.

Learn more about the platform we're building here.

ROLE

We are building an ambitious technical organization and looking for software engineers across backend, frontend, and full-stack to contribute to our mission.

You will work with our engineering and product teams in a low-debt, high-velocity environment to develop our home renovation and contractor platform.

As an early contributor, you will help contribute to key decisions about the technologies, tools, and best practices we adopt into our engineering culture. You will deliver the best experience possible for our clients while ensuring high standards of code quality. Your work will make a tangible impact on the lives of design and construction professionals along with people and their homes.

Learn more about our tech stack here.

We have three cross functional product development squads: Growth, Scope and FX.

The Growth Squad focuses on the initial experience homeowners have with our platform - from helping them visualize their new spaces to scheduling their initial calls with Block Project Planners.

The Scope Squad focuses on the interdependencies between labor, materials and costs. They help our platform get smarter and better understand the complexities and intricacies of a renovation to keep things simple for homeowners and contractors. They also build tools to help with supply chain and logistics challenges to ensure the right materials arrive on the jobs sites at the right time.

The Efficiency and Experience Squad - FX for short - focuses on the lead-up to construction, schedule and task management, and communication between homeowners and contractors.

Some products you could work on:

Visual Planner - a responsive web app for playing with different finish materials and visualizing them in real-time renders.
Digital Scope Engine - an intelligence rule engine for managing the labor scope and materials for a renovation project, as well as the associate pricing model.
Builder App - the core of the technology experience for our network of General Contractors. From the app, GCs accept new projects, manage timelines, communicate with homeowners and keep track of the success of their business on the Block platform.
Customer Dashboard - the platform where homeowners see progress on their renovation project and take action to drive it forward. Starting with the planning stage of their project, through preparing to break ground, and finally while the finishing touches are put on their space, the dashboard gives our customers a real-time view into everything happening in their space.

Some challenges you can help us solve:

How can we learn a homeowner's tastes in a fun way and use that knowledge to significantly reduce the time spent designing a space?
How can we leverage experience from hundreds of past projects to solve construction challenges that pop up during design and in the field?
How can we help GCs build their businesses and spend less time dealing with administrative work?
How can we reliably and quickly get compatible building materials to job sites?

RESPONSIBILITIES

Architect and build innovative, user friendly web applications for the renovation process
Help set and uphold high standards for code quality, test coverage, and platform stability
Collaborate on new ideas to rapidly create and test prototypes
Work alongside engineering, product, design, and business counterparts
Ensure our digital client experience is the best it can be
Continually improve the engineering team as a whole through thoughtful code review and design doc feedback
Make good, informed decisions around technical dept, 3rd party tools, and tradeoffs rather than reinventing the wheel
Iterate on internal process to help the team achieve more with less

QUALIFICATIONS

Generally, 5+ years experience developing and maintaining web applications
Expert knowledge of modern ES6 Javascript/Typescript programming, testing, troubleshooting and automation techniques
Advanced knowledge of at least one modern web UI framework such as React, Vue, or Angular. React preferred.
Proficiency in designing and building GraphQL APIs, and optimizing their performance. We use Apollo.

PTO and company holidays
3 weeks a year where you can work anywhere
401k retirement savings plan with matching employer contribution

Save money where we should
Speed is our advantage

About Infura

Infura is the leading infrastructure platform providing scalable and easy-to-use APIs and cloud solutions for blockchain and decentralized application developers. Infura currently offers APIs for Ethereum, IPFS, and other leading decentralized networks, allowing developers to immediately begin building instead of spending time on architecting and maintaining their own infrastructure.

Infura provides developers instant access to decentralized and blockchain networks without the need to sync or understand complicated peer to peer infrastructure. Similar to how one might access a cloud service to alleviate the friction of owning proprietary compute and storage, Infura lowers the barrier to entry for engineers to begin building.

We believe in a more equitable and decentralized future, and we know developers will be at the forefront of that progress. We want to empower developers to spend their time building, creating, and evolving by providing them with the best and easiest solution to their infrastructure needs.

Some things to know about the Infura team, we are a remote first company, with team members all over the world. We strive to reduce meetings, respect work life balance, promote diversity, and generally be good people. We depend on each other not only to make an amazing product but to be a group that wants to succeed together.

Infura delivers blockchain API access at internet scale. Look forward to applying the techniques and scaling tricks you've learned over your career to the emerging blockchain technology set. Using GoLang, you will build out system APIs, daemons, and other such microservices to support our high volume APIs and our customer facing fronends. You will analyze and optimize performance in high-traffic internet applications to deliver the best experience to the engineers we serve.

You will architect, design, and operate systems that provide reliable, scalable access to various blockchains and decentralized networks. Collaborate with an experienced team of senior engineers to build an infrastructure that can service a growing number of developers and projects that are building for the blockchain. The systems you build will be powering the innovation happening in the web3 world.

Would be great if you brought this to the role

Experience with Go (preferred) or Python.

Self-directed. We want you to own the systems you build.

Have built systems at scale in the past and can discuss the architectural tradeoffs that went into them.

Firm understanding of streaming vs messaging technologies.

Experience with data lakes, data warehousing, and OLAP technologies.

Bonus points for experience in any of the following: CDC pipelines, Kinesis, Kafka, Grafana and/or Tableau.

Don't meet all the requirements? Don't sweat it. We're passionate about building a diverse team of humans and as such, if you think you've got what it takes for our remote-friendly, energetic start-up environment—apply anyway. While we have a pretty good idea of what we need, we're ready for you to challenge our thinking on who needs to be in this role. We are simply looking for amazing people who share in our vision for making great things with great people.

ConsenSys is an equal opportunity employer. We encourage people from all backgrounds to apply. We are committed to ensuring that our technology is made available and accessible to everyone.

Our long-term objective is a global CI/CD framework that is flexible enough to be leveraged across dozens of teams and hundreds of applications / services, all while being simple enough to manage securely and at scale.

Experience with AWS / CloudFormation / Terraform
Policy and guardrail management to enforce best practices
Experience with Build/Release pipeline automation

About the Company:
 FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (“FLEETCOR”) is a leading global provider of business payment solutions. We help companies of all sizes control, simplify and secure payment of various domestic and cross-border payables using specialized payment products. We serve businesses, partners, merchants, consumers and payment networks in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. 
 

$2.4B Annual Revenue
600,000 Directly Served Business Clients
2.6B+ Transactions per Year
8,400+ Employees
 (as of December 31, 2020) 
 
 Our payment solutions provide our customers with a payment method designed to be superior to and more robust and effective than what they use currently, whether they use a competitor’s product or another alternative method such as cash or check. We group our payment solutions into five primary categories: Fuel, Lodging, Tolls, Corporate Payments and Gift. Each category is unique in its focus, customer base and target markets, but they also share a number of characteristics: customers are primarily businesses, have recurring revenue models, have specialized networks which create barriers to entry, have high margins, and have similar selling systems. 
 

FLEETCOR enjoys global recognition including:


Forbes Global Growth Champion – FLEETCOR is one of the 250 fastest growing companies in the world as determined by Forbes and Statista
Forbes World’s Most Innovative Companies – FLEETCOR has made this prestigious list of leading innovative companies 4 years in a row!
Fortune 1000 Company – FLEETCOR was one of the largest movers in the new rankings of the largest companies in America, ranking #872
S&P 500 – In 2018, FLEETCOR joined the S&P stock index comprised of the 500 leading US stocks based on market cap (company value)
 Our Vision 
 
 Despite many advances in our industry, the majority of business payments are still made with outdated and inferior payment methods, such as checks and cash. We envision a business world where every purchase is controlled, every payment is digital, and every payment-related decision is well-informed. In this future paperless state, payments will require little to no time to manage, leaving companies with more time for what matters most: activities that grow their businesses. 
 
 Our Mission 
 
 FLEETCOR’s mission is to provide businesses with a better way to pay, by replacing outdated payment methods such as checks and cash, and displacing the incumbent providers of those methods. Through the digitalization of payments, we create and support robust ecosystems which benefit all participating constituents: payment-making customers, payment-accepting merchants, tax-collecting governments, and FLEETCOR. 
 
 Our Strategy 
 
 FLEETCOR is a growth company, and we employ a simple three-prong strategy for growing our business: 
 

More Customers. We invest more than $200 million per year in sales and marketing, predominately focused on new customer acquisition. We continue to scale existing sales channels and headcount, enable our sales people with demand generation and other tools, and launch new distribution channels both internally and through partners such as ERP software providers, telematics companies, and banks. We will also grow our customer base inorganically through acquisitions.
More Spend. We seek to leverage our existing customer relationships and capture greater share of their business payment expenditures. As such, we have developed various “beyond” initiatives, where we extend the utility of an existing payment product without degrading the core value proposition of the original product. As such, a customer can “buy more stuff” without sacrificing the controls and reporting which attracted the customer to our product to begin with. For example:
Our Fuel card customers can enable their cards to allow non-fuel purchases relevant to their business, like allowing a painting crew to buy supplies at a home improvement store, so they can finish the paint job.
Our Toll tag customers can use their in-vehicle RFID tags to make other “on the go” purchases like parking, fuel and fast-food.
 For our customers, these product extensions reduce payment friction, saving them time and operational headaches. For FLEETCOR, these product extensions can increase our share of wallet with existing customers and can increase our products’ appeal and applicability to previously-unserved customer segments (e.g., non-toll urban dwellers). We also create new product offerings, developed internally or in conjunction with partners, to cross-sell to our existing customer base. 
 

More Geographies. We continue to seek attractive entry opportunities in major international markets, which we intend to pursue through acquisitions and partnerships.
 Our Commitment to Diversity, Equality, Inclusion, Belonging 
 
 Together we can foster true belonging. We know different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds lead to better innovation and results. We are therefore committed to building and nurturing a culture of diversity, inclusion, and belonging by: 
 

Welcoming people of different backgrounds, cultures, ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations;
Empowering our people to share their experiences and ideas through open forums and individual conversations; and
Valuing each person’s unique perspectives and individual contributions.
 Embracing diversity enables our people to “make the difference” at FLEETCOR. 
 
 Our Values 
 
 FLEETCOR’s culture reflects our history of fast growth and our continued drive for results. Our entrepreneurial spirit remains strong across our global workforce, and we reinforce these principles in our five core values: 
 

Innovation: Figure out a better way
Execution: Get it done quickly
Integrity: Do the right thing
People: We make the difference
Collaboration: Accomplish more together
 These values guide all of our employees and are infused in all aspects of our Company. We are, as a team, united through these shared values and our mission to provide “a better way to pay.” 
 
 Our values foster an inclusive culture through the expectation that all employees will treat each other with respect and appreciate the diversity of identities, thoughts, backgrounds and styles. Our commitment to fostering an inclusive culture has never been more essential than in this moment of national reflection. We must always celebrate the diversity of our company and our communities. 
 
 We strongly believe that the quality and diversity of our workforce provide FLEETCOR with a competitive advantage, and that our problem-solving and solution-building efforts are greatly enhanced when we harness the collective thinking of a diverse group of people with unique experiences and perspectives. 
 

FLEETCOR’s COVID-19 Hiring Guidelines:
 Due to COVID-19, most of our employees are temporarily working from home. In addition, FLEETCOR implemented a virtual interviewing and hiring process, engaging with talent by phone or video and onboarding new employees remotely. We value the safety of each member of our community because we know we’re all in this together. 
 

Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer:
 FLEETCOR is an Equal Opportunity Employer. FLEETCOR provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants without regard to race, color, gender (including pregnancy), religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, marital status, language, ancestry, genetic information, veteran and/or military status or any other group status protected by federal or local law.
