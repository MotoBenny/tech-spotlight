Who is Recruiting from Scratch 

 Recruiting from Scratch is a premier talent firm that focuses on placing the best product managers, software, and hardware talent at innovative companies. Our team is 100% remote and we work with teams across the United States to help them hire. We work with companies funded by the best investors including Sequoia Capital, Lightspeed Ventures, Tiger Global Management, A16Z, Accel, DFJ, and more. If you are a fit, the team will reach out to you about this role or any others that may be a fit for our clients.
  



About Our Client 



    The most recent innovation in data tools has taken place in two areas: helping data engineers produce data, and helping data consumers (primarily data analysts and scientists, but increasingly everyone) consume that data. Data warehouses and lakes are flooding with data, but the consumers still don’t know what exists and what to trust. 
   


    The biggest gap doesn’t sit in the production or consumption of data but right between them. Data Engineers continuously report being bombarded by questions from users while striving to deliver it on time and with high quality. Analysts and Data Scientists spend a huge amount of time answering questions about the source of truth of data, how it is usually used, how it gets produced, and validating that it's the right source for them to use. Our client solves this problem by providing an automation-first data discovery & catalog, built around Amundsen, an open-source data discovery engine used by 30+ companies like Lyft, ING, Square, and Instacart. 
   


    Starting in 2020, our client's product is used by companies like Flexport, iRobot, Tempo, and many others, including public financial services organizations to help with discovering, understanding, and trusting their data. Our client has strong initial traction but are still early stage: they are looking for curious engineers who are excited to rapidly iterate on new ideas with customers and build a product from the ground up. Every member of the Stemma team has the opportunity to meaningfully contribute to the direction of the product, business, and engineering culture. 
   


What They're Building 


    Automated discovery and data control. Historical data discovery systems relied on humans manually writing descriptions. Our client has seen dozens of companies try and zero are happy with the state of things. They automate this by integrating a wide breadth of data sources suggesting who uses the data, how it's used, and how it's been transformed. 
   


    Deep integrations with data systems. Many data systems in this space cater to the lowest common denominator, and obscure the incredibly powerful new data systems of the last few years. Our client deeply integrates with data systems to expose their awesomeness (e.g. Snowflake, BigQuery, Postgres, etc). These are often high data volumes, and strong architecture patterns are required. Delightful experience. The thesis of our client's product is that users will want to use it, not that they'll be forced to use it by IT teams. Building an interface that's sophisticated for power users but approachable for occasional data users is imperative 
   


About You 



You're excited to build product from the ground up, knowing it's quite probable that half of our work will become incredibly important parts of the product years down the line, and half will be unceremoniously thrown away as we learn more about our users. 
You want to work on a highly-collaborative team, but are also excited to have a great deal of your workload be self-defined. 
You have deep experience in building modern SPAs: structuring components, managing complex state (Redux/mobx/hook), 
modern JS (TypeScript, Flow, or ES8), build systems (webpack/etc). 
You're experienced in the presentation layer (modern HTML/CSS) and excited to build pixel-perfect interfaces. 
You're comfortable making small back-end changes from time to time to ship features end-to-end. 




How Our Client Works 



Remote first. Our client is a fully-distributed company, and our interaction culture is deliberately mixed between meeting culture and written. They are writing heavy because it forces clarity of thought; they have plenty of synchronous time to give space for collaborative ideation. 
Customer-oriented. Our client's tech must be highly reliable, resilient, secure, and cost-effective. But none of that matters if they're not solving the right problems, and they're very deliberate about creating the right feedback loops with their customers. Oftentimes, that feedback loop will be engineers working directly with their build partners. 
Our client's tech stack is Python, Postgres, ElasticSearch, TypeScript and Redux. 



      Our client has raised $4.8M from Sequoia. 
     



Base Salary Range: $150,000 to $200,000
    

 Benefits: Medical, Vision, Dental Coverage

When existing tech isn't enough, you are comfortable innovating new techniques and technologies. Enabling artists not only means solving technical problems but building an understanding on the team of those problems, your solutions to them and helping develop efficient workflows to utilize the graphical hotness you make possible.If you love solving tough problems with mathematical rigor, if writing code to make pixels dance to the beat of a spectacular artistic vision makes you shout with joy, if levelling up the capabilities of an art team energizes your day, then this role is for you!About Our TeamThe Engineering team at ArenaNet thrives on a wide array of perspectives, experiences, and interests. We know that the best creations come from healthy and friendly teams. Our work is woven together with the efforts of other disciplines and crafts within game development.

You are familiar with GPGPU programming to deliver amazing images at blazing speeds.You will have a deep understanding of math and physics along with expert knowledge in how to deploy their subsequent techniques for a wide range of features. You light up to solve IBL, are stoked to build 3D Fluid Dynamics, and grounded in pushing geometric tooling to build bleeding edge worlds.While mathematical simulation is an essential part of your lifestyle, you will understand when the performance tradeoffs are not worth correctness and know when to lie, cheat and steal to make the magic happen with performance always in mind. You know that sleight of hand doesn't work if the audience has time to see where the pigeon came from.Communication is central to every role on our team. Even though you will be partnered with a fellow math nerd, you are great at explaining the complexities of the work that you do to rest of us mortals in ways we can understand and appreciate. You are especially good at explaining technical constraints to artists and working with your buddy Tech Artists to help them find efficient workflows to deliver innovative visuals.

About MAQ Software
 As 2021 Microsoft Power BI Partner of the Year, we enable leading companies to accelerate their business intelligence and analytics initiatives. Our solutions enable our clients to improve their operations, reduce costs, increase sales, and build stronger customer relationships.
 Our clients consistently recognize us for providing architecture and governance frameworks, implementing best practices to optimize reports, and building team capability through training programs. Our innovative tools and 33 certified visuals expand Power BI capabilities to save time for decision makers.
 As a premier supplier to Microsoft for two decades, our clients benefit from our extensive insights on the platform and engineering practices. As a Microsoft Partner with 10 Gold competencies, our clients improve their implementations with our breadth and depth of expertise.
 With globally integrated teams in Redmond, Washington, and Mumbai and Hyderabad, India, we deliver solutions with increased velocity and tech intensity.
 Inc. magazine has recognized us for sustained growth by listing us on the Inc. 5000 list ten times – a rare honor.

 Engineering culture
 We foster a strong engineering culture with a can-do attitude. All our key managers come from excellent educational backgrounds and have significant experience growing a company and mentoring software engineers. Due to our smaller size, we adopt the latest technologies and computing trends ahead of the larger industry players. As a part of the company’s globally distributed engineering team, our engineers gain exposure to the latest software engineering practices and fast development cycles.
 Our developers routinely work on challenging technical problems that utilize the latest technologies for fast-paced software delivery.

 Examples of some of our projects:

 We built a supervised machine learning model that forecasts the impact of retail sales on our client’s overall revenue. We collected data from existing customer relationship management (CRM) and sales systems. We created a forecasting model in Azure Databricks using existing and custom linear regression to process the collected data. To reduce forecast runtime and achieve near real-time analysis, we modified the existing R libraries to SparkR. The improved insight helped our client proactively focus on retailers with the highest sales impact.
We built a check-in app for one of our client’s most attended event. A multinational technology company organizes an annual multi-event internal expo attended by thousands of their employees. The manual process of tracking attendance, sending acknowledgments, and receiving feedback was time consuming. To automate the process, we built a check-in app that uses mobile devices’ camera to capture the identification badge of each participant. The captured images are stored in an Azure Blob. An Azure Logic App reads the image content utilizing Optical Character Recognition (OCR) API to update attendance records. After the event, notifications are sent to attendees via Microsoft Teams to complete a feedback survey using a Microsoft Power Automate Bot. The Feedback App reports the survey responses to determine the Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score of the event.
For another client with high volume data, we developed and implemented a hybrid data processing solution using Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Databricks to reduce data refresh time from 3 hours to less than 30 minutes. We sourced data from the Azure Event Hub, where refreshes originate. Refreshes are captured through stream analytics and the updated data is pushed to Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS). The data is processed in ADLS, then pushed to Power BI for reporting.

 About Stellar Health:

Historically, US Healthcare has relied on a fee-for-service reimbursement system where providers are paid based on the quantity of patient visits and procedures instead of the quality of health outcomes. Stellar Health helps primary care providers continually engage with their patients by providing them real-time information and tangible action-based incentives for improving quality of care for their patients.

At Stellar Health, we're simplifying value-based care. The Stellar platform, a cloud-based, point-of-care tool, fits into existing provider workflows and creates a simple checklist of recommended actions that helps deliver the best quality care for patients. We're building our technology from the ground up, and the industry is starting to take notice.

Our product actively supports over 500K patient lives - and we have shown that we make a real difference for these practices and their patients. It's an exciting time to join the Stellar Team: We recently raised a $60M Series B at a $460M valuation from Top VCs in the health-tech space (General Atlantic, Point72, & Primary Venture Partners), have an established product & proven operating model, and we're scaling our team to meet the continued growth and impact on our healthcare system.

About the position:

As a Senior Software Engineer on one of our Platform teams, you'll be responsible for the lifecycle of our data, from ingestion to storage to insight and action generation. We currently organize these teams into two broad areas, each with a distinct focus:

Data Platform - Responsible for the ETLs, data models & storage, and serving of partner-supplied health data to downstream internal teams.
Outcomes - Responsible for translating partner-supplied health data into patient care recommendations, and associated payment awards that drive higher-quality care with lower costs.

You would join one of the teams within these broad areas, which collectively form Stellar's Platform org. Our team offers an experienced and mature engineering culture, product development best practices, and an environment where every single engineer has a direct impact on the success of our business.

Who will love this job:

You are excited about backend engineering (storage, pipelines, APIs, etc)
You thrive off of supporting your peers and teammates; no job is too small for you.
You get things done and you love working in a dynamic environment; we move quickly and we need a teammate who will too.
You understand, appreciate, and enjoy the responsibility and accountability that comes with being assigned high-level ownership over projects and their success.
You have a knack for explaining technical processes concisely (even to non-engineers), and work well with cross-functional internal teams.
You are looking to learn and grow, knowing that this position will involve a lot of ambiguity to deal with, with the support from the organization to help you navigate it.

What you'll do:

Some of the specifics depend on the team you join, but here are a few examples of common work from across the Platform org
Work on a process for consistently and coherently ingesting extracted data to our platform.
Improve tools for the data integration part of the platform.
Work on systems that generate new patient recommendations based on their health claims data
Build payments systems that reward clinical staff for their help in closing critical care gaps
Work on scaling up our platform in both the volume of data that is being processed, as well as the capabilities that we support
Write clear and concise production code for the Stellar Health Platform.
Provide effective and constructive feedback by reviewing others' work.
Deliver new features by collaborating regularly with our founding team.
Set consistent standards for code; testing and fixing bugs throughout the process.
Work with our founding team on defining product roadmaps, specifications, and priorities.
Gather data insights and build models for product improvements or for internal use.

You should have:

A minimum of 5 years experience writing production code
Previous experience in a data platform or infrastructure role.
Python experience or experience with other backend languages (Java / C++ / Go / Ruby) and a desire to learn.
A strong sense of accountability; you take pride in what you build and want it to be useful for others on your team

Pay, Perks & Such:

We offer a full slate of benefits, including competitive salaries, stock options, medical, dental, vision, life and disability coverages, a 401k program and flexible vacation.

  Company Description
   Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to make a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place. Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.



  Job Description
   The Fraud Machine Learning & Decision Science (MLDS) team within Square Risk is looking for a Senior Machine Learning Engineer. You will work on projects that enable a software driven, machine learning centric view on all money movement and every transaction within the rapidly growing Square ecosystem. This touches on actively maximizing the trade off of revenue growth and risk using artificial intelligence. The machine learning driven software that we release interacts with every transaction and money movement within our seller ecosystem - a profound degree of scale and impact. Such machine learning techniques touch on reinforcement learning, decision theory, deep learning sequence modeling, and optimization theory. In addition, we also strive to provide our sellers, through seller facing products, with transparency around why our machine learning made a particular decision. This touches on algorithms in the relatively new space of explainable artificial intelligence.

 Our algorithms derive value from our unique and rich data from our entire product portfolio within our rapidly growing seller ecosystem. We partner with business, product, operations and engineering teams to drive optimal decision making systems using sophisticated modeling and machine learning. We’re a passionate team of entrepreneurs, scientists, and engineers who are shipping machine learning software that actively actively manages Square’s view on each transaction as it pertains to our revenue growth and risk.
 You Will

 Build machine learning/deep learning models that detect risk (e.g., fraud) activity in real-time across the Square seller ecosystem consisting of payments, banking, and other commerce enablement-related products.
 Balance deeply technical concepts with creative “forward-thinking” growth principles to balance the tradeoff between risk and growth by looking holistically across the Square ecosystem.
 Collaborate with business leaders, subject matter experts, and decision-makers to develop success criteria and optimize new products, features, policies, and models




  Qualifications
   You Have

 An advanced degree (M.S., PhD.), preferably in Computer Science, Engineering, Statistics, Physics, Mathematics or a related technical field.
 PhD with 2+ years (or Master 4+ years) industry working experience on applied Machine learning or Deep learning in a production environment with a history of delivering value to customers and the business.
 A strong track record of performing modern machine learning model development using Python (numpy, pandas, tensorflow, pytorch, scikit-learn, etc.) within machine learning software development lifecycle paradigms.
 Expert-level knowledge of modern techniques in machine learning and deep learning, e.g., transformer network architectures, with an orientation to maximizing such algorithms in a large-scale production setting. The reinforcement learning experience is a plus for developing optimal control policies
 Familiarity with Linux/OS X command line, version control software (git), and general software development principles with a machine learning software development life-cycle orientation.
 Machine learning strategic sequencing of methodological and software improvements to work back from maximizing core metrics associated with optimizing the business.
 The ability to clearly communicate (verbal and written) complex results to technical and non-technical audiences and stakeholders (PMs, Operations, Engineers).

CloudHealth by VMware is looking for highly motivated individuals who will be responsible for providing outstanding customer service to ensure that customers, partners, and employees have a positive experience getting onboarding and ongoing training from CloudHealth.

 The Elevator Pitch: Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?
 You have an analytical mind and a passion for the craft of software engineering, and you love solving problems and learning new things. Technologies come and go, but that excites you because of the endless possibilities it creates. You are looking for an opportunity to work for a company whose software is utilized by every Fortune 500 company and significantly impacts every industry. You want to be a part of a collaborative environment whose teams care about the product they are creating, how they create it, and the impact it has on customers’ business objectives.

 What is primary need, technical challenge, and/or problem you will be responsible for? 
Our microservices engineering team is responsible for the architecture, design, and implementation of common services for our new platform. The CloudHealth platform manages data from multiple cloud providers in support of our 10,000+ customers. Our microservices team is developing a scalable platform to be consumed by our customers, partners, integrators, and CloudHealth feature engineering teams.
 This team is leveraging the latest technologies to build reusable core services and a data pipeline that must be secure, scalable, reliable, available, and performant. If you are great at solving scale and resiliency problems in a rapidly expanding 24/7 SaaS environment and thrive on the challenges of developing and deploying microservices, this is the team for you.
 Success in the Role: What are the performance goals over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing? 

You will be expected to produce software designs that define CloudHealth’s next generation service API and related infrastructure. These interfaces must meet VMware and industry standards and provide a consistent programming model across multiple programming languages. 
You will define and develop APIs (REST and graphQL), SDKs and CLI interfaces that offer a consistent and secure access point to the CloudHealth platform for both internal and external use cases. You will also deliver automated tests and documentation to support the adoption of these interfaces.
 You will be expected to work closely with other teams within CloudHealth that need to consume core platform features and ensure that their programmatic interface needs are met.
 You will be responsible for designing and delivering the supporting infrastructure functions to deliver your solutions at cloud-scale, including features such as usage tracking, throttling, monitoring and alerting.
 You will be regularly evaluated on the quality of the product you create and the code you write to ensure continued advancement of your technical skills in an environment that looks to expand them. 
As a member of the CloudHealth infrastructure group you will be expected to work with and contribute to its Kubernetes based microservices architecture, and all your deliverables must align with the group’s development and deployment standards.
 Advocate, encourage, and influence innovation and adoption of microservices architecture by being an effective technical leader across development teams.


 What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis? 
As a new member of the Infrastructure Platform Team (aka “Team Atlas”), you will:

 Design and develop software using a microservices architecture, with knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes, in leading cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) and build frameworks for other teams to follow your path
 Work with the team and product management to build delivery requirements
 Write technical design documents and hold reviews

You will work to resolve the root cause of endemic problems including areas where your team limits the innovation of other teams (bottlenecks). This may require you to influence technology decisions made by other teams. When confronted with discordant views, you will be able to find the best way forward and influence others to follow that path (build consensus). You will actively recruit and help others leverage your expertise, by coaching and mentoring in your organization (or at your location). You will contribute to the professional development of colleagues, improving their technical knowledge and the engineering practices. You will ensure your team is stronger because of your presence, but does not require your presence to be successful. Why it matters: Amazon and Amazon Web Services are growing at an incredible rate. To keep up with that growth, we must continually innovate with new processes and automation that simplify our operations at massive scale. You’ll have a company-wide impact; your work will impact thousands of developers and teams. You’ll help us rapidly launch and scale our services. The processes you enable will benefit Amazon’s external customers. Why you’ll love it: You’ll see all aspects of the Amazon business, from our Retail websites to our digital products to the inner workings of Amazon Web Services. You’ll work with massive data sets. You’ll improve the agility of our technical teams. You’ll be part of a growing, fast paced, and innovative team. You’ll have ownership, not just responsibility; and you’ll define and execute processes to deliver both savings and productivity for AWS and Amazon. Our ideal candidate will have a strong background in identity directory systems architecture and development with demonstrated experience designing, building, and operating global technology solutions. The candidate will possess strong written and verbal communication skills and have a successful track record of delivering large-scale engineering solutions. The desire and ability to work in a fast paced, collaborative environment is essential. This is a high-impact opportunity with interesting challenges and high visibility. We truly are looking for the highest quality candidates, so you should expect a rigorous technical interview process. 
 


Demonstrable track record dealing well with ambiguity, prioritizing needs, and delivering measurable results in an agile environment
 Extensive experience with identity and access management, directory services, and LDAP systems
 Expertise in directory schema design and data integration
 Experience with network and federated authentication protocols like Kerberos, NTLM, OIDC, & SAML
