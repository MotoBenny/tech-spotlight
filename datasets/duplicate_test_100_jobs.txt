Since our inception, our market leading cloud-native platform has offered unparalleled protection against the most sophisticated cyberattacks. We’re looking for people with limitless passion, a relentless focus on innovation and a fanatical commitment to the customer to join us in shaping the future of cybersecurity.

Interested in working for a company that sets the standard and leads with integrity? Join us on a mission that matters - one team, one fight.
  


    About the Role:
  

    CrowdStrike Falcon Host is a two-component security product. One component is a “sensor”: a driver installed on client machines that observes system activity and recognizes malicious behavior, then provides on-box prevention capability and remote telemetry to the Falcon Host cloud. The sensor processes thousands of events per second to provide deep visibility into operations on the endpoint, and performs rich correlation and computation to identify malicious events and blocks malicious activity.
  


    The cloud component aggregates sensor telemetry for each customer’s network, correlates malicious behavior across multiple machines, and presents our customers’ operations teams with a prioritized summary of the threats detected in their environments.
  


    This is a senior Software Development Engineer (SDE) role in the engineering team that delivers the sensor (lightweight agent) on Windows. SDE’s in the team own design and development of core features on the platform. Features will cross-cut most core OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and networking. Many features are also built in a way that they will have shared components across Linux and Mac. The team operates under the Agile development principles and ships frequently.
  


    Responsibilities:
  



      Provide partnership on the sensor development team involved in architecture, strategy, in building and improving next-generation Anti-Virus and Enhanced Detection and Response Security Software.
    


      Develop new product concepts.
    


      Support development teams in designing and building software with cross-platform deliverables (Windows, Mac, Linux).
    


      Own features from design to delivery including participation in product demo at the end of the sprint
    


      Collaborate with multi-functional teams in various locations
    



    What You’ll Need:
  



      In depth knowledge with C++ and Windows OS Kernel and Driver Development
    


      Strong low-level OS internals in Windows
    


      Experience debugging memory corruptions, process contentions and system performance
    


      Experience working with teams to ship major features and releases.
    


      Lead, mentor, communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a distributed team
    



    Bonus Points Awarded For:
  



      Strong background in scalable, light-weight and highly performing systems
    


      OS system expertise for core concepts and subsystems
    


      Familiarity and experience with Agile process
    


      Knowledge in Security

      Competitive vacation and flexible working arrangements

      Physical and mental wellness programs
    


      Paid parental leave, including adoption
    


      A variety of professional development and mentorship opportunities

Company Description  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.


  Job Description
   Merchants hire the Help Experience Team to provide them the right solutions at the right time to ensure they continue to be successful with their business.
 As a software engineer on this team, you'll be a part of evolving our support products for Square's millions of merchants. We leverage experimentation, personalization, recommendation relevancy, and more to ensure that we route sellers to the right help experiences at the right time according to their unique needs. We must do this with technical sustainability and scale in mind for our merchants and teams at Square to benefit from our work.



  Qualifications
   You will...

 Be exposed to and impact real business challenges.
 Identify and explore ways to improve application architecture, testing, and building pipeline.
 Continually seek to optimize and improve the seller experience.
 Iterate rapidly on features, tooling, and processes.
 Provide technical leadership, mentor and coach junior engineers.

 You’ll need to…

 Have 8+ years of engineering experience.
 Be proficient in building web apps and large-scale applications.
 Build with modern front-end and server-side technologies and frameworks
 Develop product infrastructure and web services.
 Work in a collaborative environment and partner with other cross-disciplinary teams to achieve optimal results.
 Embrace proactive and respectful communications in an inclusive environment.

 Technologies we use and teach...

 Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, TypeScript
 MySQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, Memcached

The Role:
 Do you love Javascript and are looking for a new challenge? You might be perfect for our Javascript specialist role we are currently looking to fill as we grow our team in 2022.
 As you might imagine, we’re looking for help with our front-end client applications built on the Ember.js. If you have experience in modern javascript frameworks such as Vue.js, React, or Angular.js we are interested in speaking with you, so long as you are excited by the idea of working in the framework. We believe the right person can get up to speed with a new technology and contribute in a meaningful way if the passion to do so is there.
 We’re not looking just for a front-end guru. We love design and appreciate code elegance in styling web UIs, but your specialty in Javascript will also be used in our scraper application, written on Node.js. The application is responsible for integrating with our social network partner’s APIs and payload normalization and is the backbone of the Popular Pays ecosystem.
 You will be a go-to resource for input on architecture and implementation for client and server based features scoped for our projects.
 We’re looking for a product owner for our Node.js scraper application who can help us constantly enhance and implement updates. As such, you will also be a stakeholder in our project planning cycles and have the opportunity to lead projects technically if you want that experience.
 Does this kind of work and responsibility excite you?
 About Popular Pays

Our primary product is a tech platform that streamlines the traditional content creation and influencer marketing process.

 Benefits
 We pay competitively across the tech industry (our HQ is in Chicago) based on where we believe you measure up on our engineering ladder regardless of where you choose to call home. We offer many of the perks you’ll find at other tech companies - company-issued computer, monthly office stipend, 401k, maternity & paternity leave, and generous PTO.
 Requirements
 We prefer not to set specific requirements for candidates - We know everyone has different career journeys and that’s something we embrace. If you feel confident that you would fit well into this role, we would like for you to apply!
 High level, that’s the job. We’re sure you have more detailed questions about the role and are excited to answer them during the interview process.

 Here’s a high-level overview of the core values of our engineering team:
 We believe engineering teammates are owners of the Product.
 We believe in being lean, scoping projects, shipping continuously, communicating the good and bad.
 We believe in failure - it makes us stronger.
 We believe in shipping and iteration, not endless deliberation and inaction.
 We believe you thrive in a feedback heavy culture.
 We are opinionated, but open to ideas.
 We believe in writing code that follows existing patterns where applicable and writing code that can be easily understood by the next person that works on it - we favor avoiding complexity over cleverness and over-optimized solutions.
 We believe in asking for forgiveness not for permission - autonomy and self-management are important on our lean team.
 We're an outputs not an hours motivated organization. We expect our teammates to be productive and active contributors to our business.
 Pretty straightforward stuff, but we feel like it’s important to have an identity and practice what we preach.
 Initial Application
 When you apply please be prepared to share the following with us:

 A resume that highlights your skills and experience relative to the role above.
 A CV that tells us:

A little about yourself
 What you bring to Popular Pays
 What you hope to accomplish with your time at Popular Pays
 Something that excites you about Popular Pays

Our goal is to learn as much about you as possible with your resume and CV! We take a holistic approach to hiring - we’re humans first and we believe the ability to create something worth sharing is more than the surface level of being able to write code.
 Thanks for your time and we hope to hear from you!
