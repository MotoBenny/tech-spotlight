Want to wake up every morning, knowing that you’re helping others who need a hand in life?
AidKit is a growing social impact startup on the cutting edge of Direct Cash and Basic Income explorations. We’re hiring a software engineer to be the seventh member of our team (3rd engineer). You’ll help us build our software (mostly frontend and backend Typescript) that allows organizations to distribute funds to hard-to-reach populations in a way that is incredibly efficient while upholding the dignity of all involved. We don’t care too much about work experience or pedigree, instead we care that you demonstrate a high level of ownership and that your values align with ours.
About AidKit 
AidKit is the engine that non-profits and governments trust to deliver cash assistance to those in need. We replace convoluted workflows of glued together spreadsheets, bank portals, and human tedium with one unified platform to allow organizations to operate more efficiently.
AidKit grew out of a need to scratch our own itch: our team members had raised millions in donations to support undocumented workers left out of pandemic assistance and built AidKit to distribute it efficiently:
“I lost my job due to COVID and couldn’t get unemployment. I didn’t ever think I would be able to receive this kind of help. Receiving this grant made me feel seen, that I mattered. That finally, for the first time, I was recognized in this country.” - Left Behind Workers Fund grantee
Our philanthropic roots grew into a startup, and we’ve scaled significantly. We have now served a wide variety of populations with both one-time and recurring grants, for example:

Undocumented Individuals
Unhoused People
Unlicensed Child Care Providers
Refugees

As of Feb 2022, we’ve helped our partners distribute over $45M to over 27,000 individuals and families and we expect this to grow significantly over the next year.
About the Hiring Manager 
As in any job, your happiness and fulfillment will be a function of your manager. Isn’t it wild that in most jobs you have no idea who you’d actually work for?
The hiring manager for this role is Ben Newhouse. Quick bio for him: after graduating from Stanford, he completed a full "Silicon Valley Tour," from starting a (deep-tech) company, raising millions, launching a product and then selling the company. He then subsequently went on to lead ~50 of Dropbox's best (he may be biased) engineers working on Dropbox's core technology. Today, he feels fortunate to be in a position to direct his energy toward AidKit, which brings the superpowers of software to the social sector without dehumanizing those on the receiving end of aid. In addition, he also mentors various startups and students with Neo, a new kind of community VC fund.
About the Role 
As a salaried software engineer, this role will be focused on building a high-quality, maintainable software platform for direct cash assistance at scale.
Our stack looks roughly as follows:

Typescript, React & Tailwind on the front-end
Typescript & Postgres on the backend (with some Python we’re slowly deprecating).
Pulumi for Infrastructure as Code deployments on AWS.

At AidKit our engineering team is committed to building tools that give non-engineers the agency to iterate and adapt things as needed, so that everyone can leverage their skills most effectively. In other words, our job is to empower people close to the field with the tools they need to help people—without engineering bottlenecks.
Initially, your role will be focused on the user-facing portion of the platform, although as we are a small team we expect you to jump in wherever you can help to accomplished our shared mission. In this role, you will:

Build a platform that we can be proud of, one that protects user data, is easy to extend, is efficient to develop on top of, and is documented such that new team members can ramp up quickly.
Work with the CTO to plan the platform’s technical and product roadmaps
Handle prioritization and sizing for upcoming technical work
Ensure that AidKit remains operational and in a healthy (available) state.
Assist others in the usage and configuration of the AidKit platform.
Implement new features as needed for the successful execution of assistance programs. For example; a support feature for low-tech community members that works across phone, email and SMS, a lightweight way for us to follow up with recipients of aid via SMS to confirm they’re safe and in control of their funds, and real-time streaming of applications in progress to a data platform that supports advanced queries at scale.

About You

Skilled in building web applications (Typescript preferred, but not a requirement)
Willing to jump in and do right by those we serve, whatever it takes.
You care deeply about the mission of direct aid and supporting anyone who needs help, no matter where they come from

For this full-time position, you can work from anywhere in the United States. We currently have team members in Colorado, Connecticut, California and New York. We pay everyone on our team $120k a year in salary plus equity.
Job Type: Full-time
Pay: $120,000.00 per year
Benefits:

Flexible schedule

Schedule:

Monday to Friday

Work Location: Remote

Make Work Better Every Day




    Quantum Workplace, an HR technology provider, equips workplaces with the smartest talent solutions so that they can grow and succeed. We pioneered some of the earliest employee engagement and performance software and have since partnered with thousands of organizations to drive employee, team, and business success.
  



    We’re in the business of creating awesome work environments—and are committed to being one also. We are smart people who care deeply about what we do. We work hard but laugh harder. We wear casual clothes, work flexible hours, and get stuff done. You’ll love it here.
  


 What’s the opportunity?


    We are searching for Full Stack Software Engineers to join our team in Omaha. You enjoy being surrounded by talented engineers to learn and challenge each other.
  



    You believe engineers should be involved much earlier in the process than when it's time to code (although that is pretty fun). You’d prefer to sit in on customer interviews, design sprints, early non-dev prototypes, and throw on some noise cancelling headphones when it's time to build. You strive to build beautiful, usable software, and if you aren't the type to wear your beret hat you are encouraged to work with the product designer who is a full-time resource for your team.
  



    We use our own flavor of agile processes to get things done. We use Git and an automated CI setup for builds and Octopus for shipping code to testing environments and to production. We review each other’s pull requests. We believe in automation over repetition and aim to make our code and infrastructure more scalable.
  
 Responsibilities 

Write awesome code
 Work with large, complex datasets
 Collaborate with product team to bring prototypes to production

 Qualifications

 1+ years of professional experience building software
 Must be able to work in the U.S. without sponsorship
 We're not interested in a checklist of experiences, but here is a list of things we use: .NET, C#, Flutter, Dart, SQL Server, Redis, Hangfire, Azure, IdentityServer, Sass, and probably a few more things.
 Bottom line: you need to be stellar. If you are grouchy, too political, or don’t admit mistakes, you will hate it here.


 Why Quantum Workplace?



 Health Insurance: We offer 3 options (1 option is 100% premium paid by QW for employees) + Telehealth
Dental & Vision: We cover 100% of premiums for employees
401k: We match 100% of contributions up to 4% and you're fully vested on Day 1
Adoption + Fertility assistance
Employee-led Diversity Council works to create a more diverse and inclusive workplace
Zoo memberships

Remote and hybrid work options
No dress code - wear what makes you feel confident - BE YOU!

Our state-of-the-art technology, combined with actionable best practices and a strong advisory services team, means that we provide the critical operational components required to build a responsive, resilient healthcare system.

TeleTracking values people with an entrepreneurial spirit, creativity and building strong relationships with our employees. We believe that diversity, equity and inclusion in our workforce keeps us competitive and provides opportunities for everyone.

What we need: We have big plans to re-architect, rebuild and rethink how we digest and process millions of documents every day.

Create sample document sets to help improve testing and understanding of intricate file formats
Write highly performant code to elevate processing capacity and throughput (Even small changes can have outsized effects when millions of documents flow through Logikcull)
Build software to integrate with the latest and most popular external services like Slack, GVault and more

What we’re looking for (you!): 

You are a team player, ready to support your co-workers while also raising the bar for the entire group
You have experience working in fast paced environments, shipping working software multiple times per week
You are comfortable developing in Ruby, Python, Java, or Kotlin
You have a solid grasp of computer science fundamentals
Data processing at scale sounds FUN, you weirdo
You are comfortable prototyping on a whiteboard and with example code
You believe data drives insights and helps determine where we go
You have a solid appreciation for observability and understand how to operate production software at scale

Why us?Join for the amazingly talented and kind people. Stay for the massive customer and market impact.

    At Density, we build one of the most advanced people sensing systems in the world. The product and infrastructure is nuanced and one-of-a-kind. Building this product for scale has been an exercise in patience, creativity, remarkable engineering, laser physics, global logistics, and grit. The team is thoughtful, driven, and world-class.
   


 Density systems are real-time, accurate, and anonymous by design. We help today’s largest companies understand how their buildings get used. We have counted hundreds of millions of people.
   


 Counting people in “real-time” is unique and particularly hard to achieve. It allows a user to walk into a room, beneath our sensor, and see the room’s occupancy increment 700ms later.
   


 Today alone, Density will ingest over 1m events. In the coming year, our sensor network is on track to grow ten-fold. The overall system load is exploding. Maintaining our low latency standards requires an increasingly thoughtful system.
   


 We’re architecting infrastructure where annual, unscheduled downtime is measured in minutes. We’re building intelligent redundancies so missed events are an oddity. We’re constructing an exceptional engineering team to support always-on, intelligible analytics generated on the fly.
   


 As a Backend Engineer at Density, you will be joining not only a team, but a company, that highly values you and the work you do.
   


 This role reports to our Director of Software Engineering.
    




    You can read our values here.
   



What we're looking for:

 You have 3+ years experience shaping highly scalable enterprise systems. Or can demonstrate similar proficiency. You have a command of technologies like TimescaleDB, Redis, Kafka, Postgres, AWS, Django, and Python. You have architected complex data pipelines, APIs, and data delivery mechanisms. You have had significant senior responsibility for monitoring, profiling and improving system performance. You have demonstrated the ability to navigate the nuanced needs of internal tools and customer facing systems. You can balance a demanding workload, discern priorities, and communicate tradeoffs effectively. You are resourceful, direct, helpful, driven, and mission-oriented. You have an understanding of statistical analysis and trend data modeling. You have worked with container orchestration technologies like kubernetes or nomad. You embrace the opportunity to share your knowledge. You have a working knowledge of front end technologies like ES6, React, and Redux. You have an excitement for and ability to interact directly with customers. You have an awareness of your weak spots and a genuine desire to improve. You’re looking for a long-term role with a company that has long-term ambition.





What we bring:

 A team hailing from places like Apple, LinkedIn, Stripe, Cisco Meraki, Hashi Corp, WeWork, NASA, & beyond. $227 million raised from investors like Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, and Upfront Ventures. A work environment full of fun, smart, talented, dedicated, and truly kind teammates. Our values are be humble, seek feedback, and always solve the fundamental problem. These values are hard to achieve but we aspire to them daily. Excellent benefits including medical, dental, vision, mental and reproductive health, 401K, equity, Flex Fridays, Remote Friendly, unlimited and mandatory PTO and more.





    We are looking for candidates who are strong in several areas and have exposure to or interest in the others. Most of all, we are looking for candidates who see themselves as a meaningful addition to Density’s team and culture.

About US
Ledgex is the first FinTech specifically focused on fixing the data quality challenges in multi-asset investing (think endowments, foundations, family offices). Data quality is a foundational problem in the industry, often solved through layers of manual processes, carefully interconnected systems, and heroic effort.
We're changing that, but we need more smart, user-focused, inquisitive, and talented engineers to achieve our vision. Solving the data quality problem will enable offices to more confidently and successfully manage complex portfolios, and we're building the team to make that happen.
The Position
We're continuing to develop the suite, which requires engineers like you that can dig in and learn the business, build software with an eye towards the user experience, and operate at all levels of our stack. We're expanding our accounting ability, continuing to dive deeper into data collection, and developing complex analytics, all with an eye towards user confidence, snappy performance, security, and the nimbleness to support a broad client-base.
Here's what you'll be doing
In a typical month, you will collaborate on prototypes to develop our understanding of business problems, develop features in React/C#/SQL including automated tests and telemetry, peer review work from your teammates, deploy your work to production (fully automated), and contribute insights and improvements to our tools and architecture.

Learn our domain and work with Product Managers and clients to develop and refine solutions
Build features, from digging into the details with Product Managers through development to successful operation in production
Take part in continuous improvement of our team, culture, processes, and software
Make us better by bringing complementary expertise to a team of Full Stack engineers

To be successful, we believe you need experience in

Developing in more than one fullstack SPA over several years or more: taking a feature from web components and CSS and wiring it back through API endpoints, server-side business logic, and databases or non-relational stores
Supporting production applications as a developer: reactively by troubleshooting bugs from production systems and proactively by building tooling or telemetry to increase your visibility into production
Working collaboratively with non-developers, joining your technical expertise with their domain expertise to define and iterate on solutions
Deeper expertise in at least one relevant area (T or Pi-shaped: you're full-stack but have one or two areas you've led architecture or adoption): UI/UX, accessibility, charting and graphics, front-end frameworks and architecture, backend services and/or distributed systems, security (OWASP, etc) distributed logs (Kafka/Event Hubs/Kinesis), Azure services, etc.

We would be really interested if you could show expertise and prior experience in

Our product domain: Institutional investing and working with operations or investment managers, accounting, and/or building systems in these areas
Deep expertise in our specific technologies: ASP.Net Core, React, Typescript, HTML/CSS, MS SQL Server, Azure, Azure Storage + Event Hubs

Who we are
 At Path we believe behavioral health should be treated with the same respect, rigor, and focus of other chronic diseases. We're building the future of mental health, and in 20 years we'll look back and be astounded that we ever treated the physical before the mental.
 What we're solving
 Over 65 million Americans suffer from a treatable mental health issue - that's 1 out of every 5 people. Today it's difficult to find a provider, and for those with complicated conditions, it's nearly impossible to find coordinated care. We're here to fix this.
 How we're solving
 Path is at the intersection of tech + mental health with thousands of therapists, psychiatrists, and other mental health services delivering care through a virtual first approach. Our platform matches patients with exactly the right person for their needs, whether it's experience with a certain condition, gender, race, location, life experience, etc.

 Role Overview
 As a member of Path's Engineering team, you'll be able to focus on doing your best work and create a real impact with a team of like-minded people who waste minimal time on unnecessary overhead. While we're looking for software engineers of all levels of seniority, we're excited by candidates who enjoy and are capable of working on a small team with a fast-growing product. We're looking for generalists who can work across the stack and those who gravitate towards frontend, backend, or infrastructure engineering. We recognize people are passionate about different areas and you'll have the option to be involved in as much (or as little) as you'd like.
 Today we build products for 2 primary customers; patients and therapists:
 On the patient side, we're focused on a fast and delightful enrollment where patients can find a therapist that's right for them and who takes their insurance in less than 10 minutes.
 On the therapist side, we're building a full set of practice management software including patient recruiting, scheduling, patient notes, referrals, and more. Our therapists spend all day in Path and their experience needs to be fantastic.
 This is a really unique opportunity to help build on the foundational engineering infrastructure at a company where the business is already humming and we have thousands of users every day. If this sounds exciting and energizing, we'd love to talk!
 Technical Stack
 Path's systems are written in Ruby on Rails, with React frontends. We use Postgres for our databases and everything is hosted on AWS. We also make heavy use of existing tools like Salesforce, Airtable, Typeform, etc. This has enabled us to scale very quickly with a small team but we're now ready to bring much of this work in-house. We're standing up the technical foundation that will power the future of the company. It doesn't matter if you don't have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, we'd still love to connect with you!
 What You'll Be Doing
 As an engineer at Path, you'll have endless opportunities to help build, shape, and lay the tracks for future technical infrastructure, and provide input on product, design, and cultural decisions, if that interests you.

Please Read Before Applying!
Xochi Interactive is a startup indie company. This will be our first created title; we're looking for a programmer who can take the initiative and work within the game's vision. You'll be implementing the core mechanics into the game such as movement, combat, AI, and dialogue. In addition, you'll work closely with the creative director to ensure the project stays within the scope.
PROJECT

The goal is to create a playable demo with an estimated range of 20-30 minutes of gameplay. The player character will be a knight that is traveling from one kingdom to another in an outdoor environment along a linear path. Enemy encounters will be in open-spaced areas while the paths in between will be more narrow. There will be 3 different enemy types. The demo will feature a small number of collectibles, a companion that follows you, environmental engagement, and cinematic cutscenes.

The priority is optimization with it being all outdoors. We have an ongoing list of our mechanics within a document and a GDD that you'll be given access to. You will be working with marketplace assets to speed up the development process but core features like combat will need to be created manually. The project will use Perforce as its choice of source control. The goal is to create a project everyone on the team is proud of. We are developing a free demo and below is our website that gives a little detail about the project we are developing.
Website: https://xochi-interactive.com/
If you'd like to see what assets you'll be possibly working with search for the assets listed below in Unreal's Marketplace.

Motion Symphony
Hit Trace Detection
Dialogue Plugin
The Targeting System

PAYMENT
Unfortunately, since we are a start-up company the payment isn't as high as we wish we could pay, but I don't want people to work for free. When the programming is complete and bugs have been fixed after playtesting the pay will be $1,500. How the payment is dispersed can be discussed, it can either be at the end or during milestones. We hope to find someone who is just as passionate about the project as the rest of the team.
If the team works together and can push out a well-polished game, we aim to seek funding for the full version. This will hopefully open up future opportunities and allow us to build upon the demo for a full-length game. If you enjoyed working on this project and would like to be a part of the full project, we'd like to keep all team members on board from the demo to the full game if possible.
WHY WORK WITH XOCHI INTERACTIVE?
We support creativity and keep gamers in mind when we work on any type of project. Our goal is to focus on story-driven titles, none of our titles will have microtransactions or DLC. We are adamant about publishing full and complete titles, then moving on to the next project.
If you're interested in building the founding blocks of a project, then this is for you. Starting out, you will be the primary programmer on the project as of right now. We do plan on bringing in a UI programmer to focus on UI-related tasks. The goal is to have the demo completed by late October and QA with bug fixes to be completed by December. To have this wrapped up by Christmas is the goal; however, we did account for issues, so we will not be officially launching Kickstarter until March/April of 2023. This will give us time to gather material from our project to put together and promote.
REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE

Rapid Prototyping
Asset Integration
Familiarity with assets from Unreal Marketplace and the willingness to learn assets that are implemented.
Version Control (Perforce)
Self-motivated & willing to improve a project
Excellent communication
Experience with scripting
Project Management Software (ClickUp, Jira)
Ability to learn new tools to improve gameplay quality/optimization
Positive attitude and willingness to help in any way.

PREFERRED

Portfolio (Showcase previous work)
Shipped titles (Preferred but not required)
Familiarity with Motion Symphony is a plus
Combat programming experience is a plus

If this is a position you're interested in and you'd like to be a part of a passionate team include a cover letter explaining what you can bring to the team and why this is something you're interested in. This will also let me know if you read the full job description and are more interested in the position. Look forward to discussing the project more with you!

 Do you want to change the world? We do, too.

This is a green field opportunity allowing for impact at scale almost immediately.

About UsAt Close, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals (faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of ~55 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.
Our app’s frontend is a single-page JavaScript web app mostly written in React (originally built with Backbone.js). We bundle with Webpack and target only modern browsers. We test with Jest and React Testing Library. Our UI updates in near real-time and is written in LESS/CSS (with flexbox and grid layout) using CSS modules and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets and WebRTC.
We care about performance (e.g. route-based code splitting), maintainability, and testability of our frontend code. We sweat the UI/UX details and work collaboratively with the Product team throughout the design process. This means diving into lo-fi wireframes, and communicating continuously when those ideas are brought to life using Figma and code.
Our frontend app is built on top of our REST API & GraphQL endpoints. Our backend tech stack consists of Python/Flask, MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. We run our services in Docker on AWS.
We ❤️ open sourcing our code and ideas on our GitHub and on The Making of Close, our behind-the-scenes Product & Engineering blog. Check our projects such as react-custom-scroller, use-infinite-scroll, use-abortable-effect, and smart-tooltip-delay or insights from our day-to-day work on such as Highlights From a Complex Downshift.js Refactor, A Case Study in"Reactizing" a Complex Backbone View, and Finding the cause of a memory leak in Jest tests.
*About You*We're looking for an experienced full-time Frontend Engineering Manager to join our engineering team. You should be an empathetic leader, have spent part of your career as a senior-level engineer, and want to help build & grow a team of high-performing engineers.
You should have senior-level (4 years+) experience building modern frontend applications, preferably using React or similar framework.
You should have significant experience (2 years+) leading and growing a team of engineers. You enjoy helping engineers thrive and grow in their roles. You should have a very good idea of how to run 1:1s with your direct reports and how to form strong relationships. You should be comfortable with giving continuous feedback and doing performance reviews. You are expected to grow the team as-needed and help lead a hiring process.
You have a track record of managing engineering teams that delivered great products and features. You should be very comfortable working with the Product and Design teams to formulate product ideas, skilled at writing & reviewing technical specifications, and planning work for your team. You can take on non-critical path technical work if time allows.
You’re comfortable working in a fast-paced environment with a medium-sized talented team where you're supported in your efforts to grow professionally. You are able to manage your time well, communicate effectively, and collaborate in a fully distributed team.
You are located in an American time zone.
Bonus points if you have...

Experience practicing the Shape Up product development methodology
Experience scaling a small engineering team into a few teams
Experience building JS-based mobile apps
Built B2B SaaS products
Experience with sales or sales tools

About the Role

Manage and grow a team of 4-8 high-performing engineers, support them through 1:1s and continuous feedback, and support their career growth.
A mix of team leadership, people management, product ideation, project coordination, and maximum 10% of your time spent on non-critical path IC work.

 Partner with product, design and other stakeholders in designing new features
 Collaborate with other engineers in architecting and implementing new features
 Develop, test, deploy, maintain and improve our products
 Deliver performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code
 Manage individual project priorities, deadlines, and deliverables
 Demonstrate expertise in at least one or two areas where you can drive technology (micro-services, front-end, API design, TDD, infrastructure, open-sourcing tools)
 Deliver performant, reliable, scalable, and secure code

 What you bring:

 3+ years of software development experience working with languages such as Ruby, Python, or GoLang
 Solid understanding of Computer Science fundamentals such as relational databases, data structure and algorithms, Object Relational Mapping, REST APIs, microservices, etc.
 Strong collaboration, communication and project management skills
 A strong sense of ownership
 A great desire to learn, collaborate, improve, and innovate

 The base salary for this position will vary based on geography and other factors. In accordance with Colorado law, the base salary for this role if filled within Colorado is $106,250-$125,000.

We are a dynamic team of advanced security researchers, software engineers, services experts, sales professionals, marketing gurus and financial managers that are looking for inspired, entrepreneurial and hard driving new team members to join us on our mission!

 Responsibilities:

 The Services Automation Engineering role at NowSecure is no ordinary AE role. We are trying to push mobile appsec testing to new heights through dynamic testing. We define Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) as: “fully exercising the compiled mobile binary, validating issues by interacting with the app on a real device, like an end user will.” In our use case, strive to write elastic automations that account for various device and connectivity states.

 The NowSecure AE role can be broken down into two primary states, automation and advancement.

 Automation:

 Writing automation scripts is the easy part. We can do this in our sleep. Getting them to work in various environmental conditions and making them reliable is the hard part. Roughly 80% of the time spent on writing automation scripts is used troubleshooting elasticity and reliability.

 Advancement:

 Advancement is where all the magic happens. The AEs are challenged to find sustainable ways to reduce human necessity and involvement around automation, both writing and maintaining. Below are a handful of topics AEs work on.

 Generalization of device states to improve automation reliability.
 Bypassing anti-automation features
 Advancement of open-source UI automation tools.
 Data population and analysis of automation reliability.
 Development of internal automation tools.


 Baseline Requirements:

 Curiosity, desire to grow, and a drive to learn new things.
 An understanding of foundational software engineering concepts. Code efficiency, memory usage, data structures, and syntax.
 Intermediate knowledge of (Python, Swift, or JavaScript)
 Technical experience troubleshooting code and proactive problem solving.
 Experience working independently and meeting goals on-time.
 Ability to collaborate with multiple departments and individuals as needed.


 Bonus Experience:

 Have you made it this far? Bonus experience is exactly what it sounds like, the icing on the cake. What if you don’t have the experience listed below, but you feel you are the perfect person to be an AE? Tell us in a cover letter why your experiences make you an ideal candidate. If you were wondering, yes, we read your cover letters.

 UI Test Automation or Black Box Testing.
 Android or iOS app development.
 Familiarity with XCode’s XCUITest
 Experience sideloading apps.
 Familiarity with mobile app security, pentesting, or assessing vulnerabilities.
 Familiarity with Gitlab or Jira.


 What we offer:

 We are striving to save the world from unsafe mobile apps and we are striving to build an inclusive environment for all our employees. At NowSecure you will have the opportunity to be more than an automation engineer, you will have a voice in shaping the teams you work with, the company, and potentially the AppSec community itself.

 Below you will find some of the other great benefits NowSecure offers.

Philo: TV on the Internet (TVoIP)At Philo, we’re a group of technology and product people who set out to build the future of television, marrying the best in modern technology with the most compelling medium ever invented — in short, we’re building the TV experience that we’ve always wanted for ourselves. In practice this means leveraging cloud delivery, modern tech stacks, machine learning, and hand-crafted native app experiences on all of our platforms. We aim to deliver a rock solid experience on the streaming basics, while cooking up next generation multi-screen and multi-user playback experiences.Android at PhiloThe Android team at Philo is responsible for building our product experience on four different platforms from one codebase — Android Mobile, Android TV, Amazon Fire Tablets, and Amazon FireTV. We’re a small autonomous team building apps with high engagement and millions of installs, which collectively are responsible for a huge fraction of the billions of minutes watched on Philo each year. We are passionate about crafting the best possible UX to connect our users with the content they love, providing a seamless viewing experience while surprising them with new features and capabilities.Recent projects on our Android platform have included:

Leading development of our Philo Connect feature, a cross-platform second-screen experience that lets you fully control your large screen (“Ten foot”) viewing experience from your smartphone, maintaining a synchronized playback session that lets you browse for new content while controlling your current content playback. This technology is also the building block for upcoming co-viewing features.
Building a generic focus management framework that we think simplifies a lot of the gaps in system focus, and is much lighter-weight than leanback's GridView. It is a set of custom views that delegate focusSearch and onRequestFocusInDescendants. We hope to open source this library very soon!
Starting to build out Kotlin Multi Platform libraries to share code between our iOS and Android apps.
Developing our own lightweight MVI framework that we built on top of RX, which we are now starting to port over to coroutines.

Philo engineers own what they build from start to finish and are passionate about continuously delivering delightful features to a huge user base.

We use a modern tech stack: React, TypeScript, Redux Sagas, Apollo, Emotion (CSS-in-JS), Webpack

Textio's mission is to build software that creates understanding between people. Textio’s category-defining augmented writing platform has already transformed the way that thousands of companies write and hire, and we’re looking for a creative and driven Senior Software Engineer to help us bring our software to more places people write every day.

2021 was the strongest year in Textio history. We shipped several new products and doubled the size of our customer base. 2022 promises to be even more exciting: more new products coming to market, an ambitious revenue plan, and substantial team growth.

As an engineer on the Application Engineering team you’ll work alongside industry-leading designers and product managers to help create ground-breaking user experiences. We are the team that builds the frontend for Textio’s user-facing applications, from our guidance canvas for rich text editing to our in-depth analytics dashboards to our browser extension and integrations.

In this role you will:
Build human-centric UX using technologies like React, TypeScript, and CSS-in-JS. We value an ability to learn and grow together above knowing any particular technology
Focus on developing user experiences, with the option to jump in and solve hard problems across the entire stack

Mentor others on the team to help them grow as engineers across many dimensions
Lead technical initiatives or feature teams by partnering with teammates across Design, Product, Data Science, and Backend Engineering to drive sophisticated features from start to finish
We’d love to hear from you if:
You have 3+ years of experience writing production software
You take pride in creating powerful experiences that are simple and intuitive for users
You have strong systems-level thinking and can reason technically across an entire product
You’re naturally curious about the technologies you use and take initiative to dive in, ask questions, and figure things out
You build those around you through mentoring, sharing what you know, and balancing the perspectives of everyone
You thrive in an environment that tests ideas by building
You have a track record of trying and learning new things
You have a point of view but are low ego
[Amazing but not required] You have production experience developing extensions for browsers, native applications, or any other software.
Benefits

We are building a truly diverse, equitable, and inclusive engineering team. We have a number of outstanding benefits to support that.

We are a fully distributed team. Without a central office, everyone’s on an equal footing wherever you’re based. Our positions are open to residents of California, Colorado, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Texas, and Washington.
We offer flexible schedules and unlimited time off. Take vacations to recharge and work the schedule that makes sense for you. We’re about long-term growth and success, so that means working sustainably.
We provide outstanding health care, dental, and vision coverage for you and your family.
We offer paid time to volunteer at non-profits. If you volunteer enough, we'll match your hours with donations.
You'll have access to on-demand, personalized coaching with Bravely.

The base salary range for this role’s listed level is currently $151,500 - $185,000. Grade level and salary ranges are determined through interviews and a review of education, experience, knowledge, skills, abilities of the applicant, equity with other team members, and alignment with market data. We will provide more information on our benefits and equity upon requests. Sales roles are also eligible for incentive pay targeted up to or over 100% of the offered base salary (no cap). Disclosure as required by the Colorado Equal Pay for > Equal Work Act, C.R.S. § 8-5-101 et seq.

 Who You Are:

We are looking for a full-stack software engineer to join our Maker engineering group and help our customers tell their best digital stories. Our ideal teammate is highly collaborative, humble, and curious about customer problems. We value our team's diverse backgrounds, and are always looking for candidates with unique experiences and skill sets. Storyblocks is technology-agnostic, so we care less about what programming languages you know and more about your ability to solve problems.

What You Bring to the Table:

Full-stack experience: You have experience writing well-designed, well-tested, and easy to read code. Full-stack knowledge is a plus, but isn't required.
Curiosity: You are interested in solving hard problems, and enjoy exploring new technologies and ideas. You enjoy diving into unknown territory with the help of your team.
Ownership mentality: You believe in "leaving it better than you found it", whether that means refactoring some code, adding a unit test, or following up on a customer issue.
Growth mindset: You are eager to find ways to improve yourself and your team. You are open to feedback from your teammates and actively participate in code reviews.
Team player: You work best as part of a team (no matter where they're located). You are humble, supportive, and empathetic. You foster an inclusive environment for your team and are always open to new ideas.

What You'll Do:

Sitting on the Maker engineering group, you'll focus on building our easy-to-use video editor that fully integrates into our media library. You'll work across the tech stack to build out our visual editor on the front-end and our encoding engine on the back-end.

Requirements and Qualifications

Experience with JavaScript (2+ years)
Experience with React (2+ years)
Experience with the Redux state management framework
Experience with HTML and CSS (2+ years)

What We Bring to the Table:

Competitive and fair compensation: We believe in fair pay-equal pay for equal work. For each title, we have consistently applied competitive salary bands based on market data and benchmarks. What you've been paid before, fear of conflict, or willingness to negotiate does not play a part.
401(k) retirement plan: We offer both a Traditional and Roth 401(k) with a company match.
Company-paid medical: Our medical, dental and vision premiums are covered 100% for you and your dependents.
Paid parental leave: Welcoming new family members is exciting, but it can also be challenging. We offer twelve weeks paid leave for primary caregivers and four weeks for secondary caregivers. We have a dedicated private nursing room available to new mothers.
Unlimited vacation: At Storyblocks we take vacation seriously. That means take the time off when you need it. Don't worry about tracking hours or accounting for partial days. Typically employees take about three or four weeks each year.
Flexible work-from-home options: Much of our workflow is online, and for meetings, we have dedicated video-conferencing setups. As long as you deliver results, you are welcome to get your work done outside of the office or during unusual times when desired.
Company-sponsored mentorship and growth: We have a formal mentorship program that involves regular career and growth conversations. "360-degree" feedback is collected twice a year and synthesized into actionable, peer-reviewed, performance reviews. We happily foot the bill for conferences and online courses that will add value to the organization. We encourage attending meetups and are happy to host them as well.
Casual Work Environment: Sure we all get dressed up once in a while, but in general we want you to be comfortable at the office – whatever that means to you (flip-flops, shorts, jeans, etc.).
Fully stocked kitchen: Everyone gets input on the food and drinks we stock in our shared refrigerators and snack room. We have multiple mechanisms for making coffee and cold-brew kegs are often on tap.
Dogs in the office: We love dogs and we will probably love your dog too. With help from a calendar, we allow employees to bring in their dogs to help guide us through the day.

Who We Are:

Storyblocks is a different kind of content company delivering a fresh approach to meet the creative needs of a new generation of storytellers. Built on the belief that all stories deserve a chance to be told, Storyblocks provides video, audio, images and easy to use creative tools through its unique subscription model. By offering unlimited downloads and continually adding fresh content, Storyblocks challenges the paradigm that your ambitious vision requires deep pockets. We are committed to empowering storytellers by removing creative barriers and democratizing video creation.

Driven by a set of five company core values, our culture is shaped by a love for data, fearless communication, community, zero egos, and everyone emptying the dishwasher (both literally and figuratively). Also, loving dogs. That's pretty important too.

Headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, Storyblocks has been recognized as one of Washington D.C.'s Top Workplaces by The Washington Post, among the Best Places to Work by the Washington Business Journal, and by the Washingtonian as one of DC's 50 Great Places to Work.

Storyblocks does not discriminate in employment matters on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, military service eligibility, veteran status, sexual orientation, marital status, disability, or any other protected class. We support workplace diversity.

   A BIT ABOUT US
  

    Lever's vision is connecting human potential to meaningful work. Hiring is the most strategic challenge that every company faces, and Lever is one of the most recognized brands in talent acquisition software. As the innovation leader in our space, we are searching for great people to join us and push further.
  


 We are proud of the company we’ve built so far, but we are even more excited for what is yet to come. Our 5000+ customers include global leaders, startups that are disrupting industries, and businesses around the world. Lever has raised $123 million in funding, most recently a $50M Series D in November 2021.
  


 With an overall gender ratio of 50:50 women and men, Lever is also fiercely committed to building a team culture that celebrates diversity and inclusion. We have been certified as a “Great Place to Work”, along with “Best Company Outlook 2022,” and “Forbes Best Startup Employers 2022,” and the list keeps growing! Our people are Lever’s biggest competitive advantage. For more information on our team culture, visit https://inside.lever.co/.
  



    THE OPPORTUNITY
  

    As a Software Engineer, you’ll help us build out our core product by developing high-impact, user-facing features. In our growing engineering organization, you’ll be developing and shipping new features and updates to Lever’s product. You’ll be learning about our real-time web stack UI frameworks that help us deliver a beautiful and high quality solution to our customers. You’ll work collaboratively with product managers and designers to drive the implementation and release of major features, and be a champion of best practices for writing well-tested, well-organized code.
  



    You’ll become familiar with all parts of our stack from end to end. You’ll design and implement your features to be scalable and resilient. That might include challenges like the complexities of a real-time, single-page web application, scaling backend services under high load, and developing search algorithms to enable unique features. You’ll be a driver for positive change to Lever’s engineering culture, processes and technology.
  



    THE TEAM
  

    You’ll join a team where everyone—including you—is striving to constantly improve their knowledge of infrastructure, systems, and cares about minimizing downtime. We are an incredibly supportive team–we love to pitch in when problems arise and give great peer feedback to help each other grow. We are passionate about lots of things-automation, friendly chat bots, creating a great hiring experience, and a great user experience-and we love sharing those passions with each other.
  



    Read about what our team values and why here.
  



    THE TECH STACK
  

    Lever uses our own open source MVC framework called Derby that syncs all data via Operational Transformation (the algorithm behind Google Docs). OT is the way we handle concurrency conflicts for any piece of data that is edited at the same time. In addition to real-time sync, OT allows us to provide a smoother UI since we can render updates on the client instantly without waiting for our backend to respond, while still guaranteeing consistency.
  



    Lever makes extensive use of AWS, Docker, Node, Mongo, ElasticSearch, and Redis within our infrastructure. We use tools like Hubot to streamline deployments and Grafana to see what’s going on under the hood. In addition to automating all the things, we love to version them too! Our systems are all created using Terraform and Chef, working together to ensure consistency at all costs.

Candidates for this senior role will typically have at least 4+ years experience and will be most successful if they have a desire to grow in our entire stack but specialize immediately in the frontend.

What you will do:
Frontend Engineer
As a front-end engineer, you'll work alongside back-end engineers, designers, testers, and product managers to figure out how best to meet our customers' needs in a lean, accessible, internationalized, and extensible way.
Our frontend codebase depends primarily on React, Webpack, and SCSS-preprocessed CSS, with a sprinkle of legacy jQuery and Backbone that we're working on replacing.

A strong peer review culture is incredibly important to us. Everyone strives to improve every day, and the code review process is vital to this goal.
Frontend Architecture
Engineers across the stack are responsible for not just following but contributing to our various Style Guides.

You have experience writing and maintaining code with a team at scale.
Working Cross-Functionally
You have experience working closely with back-end engineers, designers, testers, and product managers. People skills, along with a desire to both learn and teach, are essential.
Producing value, not work

Showing progress through iteration
You take a big problem and decompose it into shippable chunks that can ensure all parties are aligned on the outcome.

Location: Full Time - Rochester, NY/Remote


    Measures for Justice is a non-partisan, fast-paced, entrepreneurial non-profit on a mission to make good criminal justice data available and actionable to spur reform. Since 2011, we have pioneered a methodology to compare how different justice systems perform on the county level and led the charge to improve county-level criminal justice data. While we do not advocate for any specific reforms, we do work to make change possible by increasing system transparency, accessibility, and accountability. We’ve got world-class criminal justice data and technology chops. And a culture that demands excellence, rigor and people who like to make good ideas come to life. 
   Our Premise


    Local communities and the institutions that serve them are in the best position to reshape how their criminal justice system works. 
   What Problem Is MFJ Trying to Solve?


    The data communities need to make informed decisions about system performance and change are in short supply. The same goes for accountability and transparency. As a result, communities and the institutions that serve them are not equipped to work together on lasting change.
  


 How Does MFJ Aim To Solve This Problem?


    We’ve developed a new model for the community and the prosecutor/police/courts to work together to create a space for making criminal justice data transparent and shared goals public via a public dashboard called Commons.
  

 The Job


    As a Web Developer, reporting to the Director of Product Engineering, you will work on an agile team of talented developers to create data-centric, web based products that help bring transparency to the criminal justice system and reflect MFJ’s social impact mission.
  

 What You Will Do


    You will be working in a full Javascript stack leveraging React, D3, Next.js, Node, Typescript and GraphQL and will be developing and supporting both public facing products as well as internally facing data processing tools. Our overall tech stack includes HTML5/CSS, React, Node, Next.js, D3, Kotlin, Java, Postgres, Docker, AWS services (including S3 and DynamoDB), Redis, GraphQL, Kubernetes.
  

 About You




      You are continually improving your craft and are eager to work with the latest technologies.
    


      You have strong design and critical thinking skills, with knowledge of web development best practices.
    


      You are creative with an intuitive sense of design. You have a mastery of HTML5/CSS and can develop a UI without a framework, but have also worked with frameworks such as SASS, Tailwind, Bootstrap, or Foundation.
    


      Your programming skills are way above average, you’re admired by your peers and have had a continuous string of successful projects.
    


      You are familiar with accessibility best-practices. You write semantic HTML that can be navigated with just a keyboard, and you know when to use (and not use) ARIA attributes.
    


      You have worked with JavaScript libraries/environments such as React, Node, Next.js, D3,UI component libraries.
    


      You have prior professional experience working for a criminal justice agency (preferred).
    


      1+ years professional web development experience (Co-ops and Internships apply).
    


      BS or MS in Computer Science or related discipline or an equivalent combination of education and experience.
    


 Next Steps


    To apply, please visit our website - https://www.measuresforjustice.org/about/jobs
  


 Review of applications will begin 
   immediately
 and will continue until the position is filled.
  

 Measures for Justice (MFJ) is committed to fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion in our workplace.

 See yourself at Twilio

Join the team as our next Backend Software Engineer (L3).

Who we are & why we're hiring

Twilio powers real-time business communications and data solutions that help companies and developers worldwide build better applications and customer experiences.

Although we're headquartered in San Francisco, we have presence throughout South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. We're on a journey to becoming a globally anti-racist, anti-oppressive, anti-bias company that actively opposes racism and all forms of oppression and bias. At Twilio, we support diversity, equity & inclusion wherever we do business. We employ thousands of Twilions worldwide, and we're looking for more builders, creators, and visionaries to help fuel our growth momentum.

About the job

This position is needed to support Twilio Engage as a Backend Software Engineer.

As a Backend Developer in the Twilio Engage pillar, you'll have the opportunity to grow and evolve a young product family, but also to see the rapid adoption of your creation as Twilio Engage reaches new customers. The team is also growing fast, and you'll have the opportunity to help guide that growth.

We work primarily with Go, Kafka, and NodeJS. The core of the application is based on streaming data, so candidates will need to reason about both time-delayed events and distributed systems.

This product faces enterprise-scale usage already, despite being very early in its life cycle. Engineers must deal with scaling out existing backend tools, planning and designing new features to fit in with existing ones.

You will need to understand and articulate the trade-offs between new functionality and stability. You will need to persuade all involved to make the right architectural choices for the long-term technical health of the product.

Responsibilities

In this role, you'll:

Work with a collaborative team to brainstorm ideas, build new features, and scale out our platform.
Design engineering solutions, execute on projects, and debug complex systems and applications.
Review code, offer improvements to practices and processes to impact the team and larger organization.
Collaborate with cross-functional partners from Product, Design, and Engineering to deliver on projects and influence product roadmaps and sprints.
Put yourself in the customers' shoes by understanding how they use our products and advocating for solutions that represent their needs.
Cultivate a culture of empowerment and psychological safety.
Qualifications

Not all applicants will have skills that match a job description exactly. Twilio values diverse experiences in other industries, and we encourage everyone who meets the required qualifications to apply. While having "desired" qualifications make for a strong candidate, we encourage applicants with alternative experiences to also apply. If your career is just starting or hasn't followed a traditional path, don't let that stop you from considering Twilio. We are always looking for people who will bring something new to the table!

Required:

3+ years of industry experience.
Strong engineering fundamentals, with fluency in languages such as NodeJS, Go.
Experience designing, developing, and operating services in cloud-deployed environments.
Exposure to SDLC from reviewing requirements to debugging complex systems in production.

Desired:

Bachelor's and/or Master's degree, preferably in Computer Science, or equivalent experience.
Experience building API products with frameworks such as REST and GraphQL.
Fluency in Kafka and Go, or related technologies.
Location

This role will be based in the US as a remote position. No travel is required.

What We Offer

There are many benefits to working at Twilio, including, in addition to competitive pay, things like generous time-off, ample parental and wellness leave, healthcare, a retirement savings program, and much more. Offerings vary by location.

Twilio thinks big. Do you?

We like to solve problems, take initiative, pitch in when needed, and are always up for trying new things. That's why we seek out colleagues who embody our values — something we call Twilio Magic. Additionally, we empower employees to build positive change in their communities by supporting their volunteering and donation efforts.

So, if you're ready to unleash your full potential, do your best work, and be the best version of yourself, apply now!

If this role isn't what you're looking for, please consider other open positions.

Colorado applicants:

The estimated pay range for this role, based in Colorado, is $132,320 - $165,400.
Additionally, this role is eligible to participate in Twilio's equity plan.

The successful candidate's starting salary will be determined based on permissible, non-discriminatory factors such as skills, experience, and geographic location within the state. This role is also eligible to participate in Twilio's equity plan and for the following benefits: health care insurance, 401(k) retirement account, paid sick time, paid personal time off, paid parental leave.

 About Anomalo

Much like software before it, data is the next competitive battleground for modern enterprises. As a result, more and more companies are rushing to stand up their data stack and become data-powered organizations.

But every data-powered company quickly encounters one unfortunate fact: much of their data is missing, stale, corrupt, or prone to unexpected and unwelcome changes. Because of this, companies spend more time dealing with issues in their data rather than unlocking that data's value.

Anomalo addresses this problem by adding a new layer to the Modern Data Stack: a Data Quality Platform that monitors enterprise data to automatically detect and root-cause any data issues, thus allowing teams to resolve any hiccups with their data before making decisions, running operations, or powering models.

We help companies trust the data they use to make decisions and build products.

We work with some of the biggest brands like BuzzFeed, Discover Financial Services, and Substack. We're raised over $39m in seed and Series A funding backed by top-tier venture firms like Norwest Venture Partners, Foundation Capital, Two Sigma Ventures, and First Round Capital. We are building the platform that data-driven companies need to stay data-driven, and would love to have you join us for the ride!
What you'll do as a Frontend Engineer at Anomalo:
Own end-to-end development of new product features alongside product and design
Translate designs, sketches, and product ideas into functional and reusable UI components that are beautiful and delightful to use
Maintain Anomalo's React-powered front end platform to ensure usability, scalability, and maintainability
Interact with end-users to deeply understand their needs and build the right solution
Build and maintain a reusable and well-tested component library
Continuously improve our front end tooling and infrastructure to improve developer experience and code quality
Qualifications you'll ideally have:
5+ years of experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
2+ years of experience with React
Passion for great user experience and design
Experience designing, building, and maintaining scalable front-end systems
Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science or a related discipline or equivalent practical experience
Nice to have:
Python and Django experience
Experience with modern visualization frameworks
Front end experience on a SaaS or Data product
Familiarity with server-side web technologies
Technologies we use:
Python (django / celery / numpy / pandas)
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet / Greykite)
JavaScript (React / Hooks / TypeScript)
Databases (Postgres / Redis / DynamoDB)
Cloud (AWS - EC2, RDS, ECS, S3 / GCP / Azure)
CI/CD (AWS CodeBuild / GitHub Actions)
Containers (Docker / Kubernetes)
Data warehouses (Snowflake / BigQuery / Redshift / Presto / Synapse / DeltaLake)
Perks of working with us

‍ We were fully remote before it was a thing, your best work happens on your schedule
✈️ Unlimited vacation that we encourage you to take
 Top of the line family-friendly medical, dental, and vision insurance plans
 16 weeks paid maternity/paternity leave because family comes first
 A radically open and transparent culture that supports autonomy and growth
 Meaningful employee equity packages plus life insurance and a 401k plan
