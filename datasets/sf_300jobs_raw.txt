NextEra Energy Resources is one of the largest wholesale generators of electric power and renewable energy from the wind and sun in North America.

 Position Specific Description

 eIQ Mobility, a subsidiary of Nextera Energy, is a data science and software company based in San Francisco, CA. eIQ Mobility is the leading software provider of fleet electrification solutions, building the most trusted platform that drives vehicle fleets into a smart, electric, and cost-effective future. eIQ Mobility was founded in 2018 in response to the unique roadblocks that corporate and public fleet leaders face in electrifying their vehicles, starting with identifying ‘where and how’ to electrify. To date, eIQ Mobility has assessed 150,000+ vehicles for EV feasibility for Fortune 500 companies, EV manufacturers, utilities, and public fleets.

 eIQ software engineers collaborate with data scientists, product experts and business leaders to design, build, and maintain applications that model and operate electrified fleets. We work as a team: each of us taking their turn to lead, follow, teach, or learn as the occasion requires. On any given day, one of us might:

 Write a small web service using Python’s Flask framework
 Review a colleague’s PR for functionality, security, and quality
 Debug a container orchestration issue on Google Cloud
 Write a script to load customer data into our SQL store
 Tweak a ReactJS component holding a data visualization
 Consult with business leaders on a utility-scale clean energy initiative

 You might be a good fit for this role if:

 You have excellent cloud software development skills: distributed system design, container orchestration, data engineering, integrated testing, and the review of complex patches
 You are an exemplary teammate: always ready to help a colleague, express complex concepts clearly, listen to complicated explanations patiently, do unavoidable chores cheerfully, and leverage your attention effectively
 You will be very productive with our primary toolkit: Python, SQL, HTTP, bash/POSIX, and container orchestration
 You can occasionally contribute to our secondary needs: Google Cloud administration (Kubernetes, CI/CD, GCP-specific data services), ReactJS, visualization and observability
 (We would like at least one of our new colleagues to have strong Kubernetes skills)
 You have previous experience with data science pipelines, the transportation industry, or electricity systems
 You have a passion for decarbonizing transportation and want a career that positively impacts millions of human beings

 We strongly encourage you to apply:

About Us
 At Saildrone, we sustainably explore, map and monitor the oceans to understand, preserve, and protect our world. Saildrone designs and manufactures wind and solar powered autonomous surface vehicles called Saildrones, which make cost-effective ocean data collection possible at scale. We work with governments, civic agencies, foundations, universities, and private companies around the globe to drive better information about our oceans and seas - be it in sailing drones into the eye of a Category 4 hurricane to obtain new scientific storm data, mapping out the ocean floor, collecting new CO2 data in hard-to-reach areas, counting biomass to establish fishing quotas, or detecting and stopping illegal fishing and drug trafficking. As a result of our work, we have been selected as one of the "Forbes Top 10 Wonders of 2021", as well as the Smithsonian Institute's "Top 10 Ocean Stories of 2021", New York Times' "Top 21 Things that happened (for the first time) in 2021", and Popular Science's "100 Greatest Innovations of 2021". We are based in Alameda, CA, with offices in Washington DC and St. Petersburg, FL and operate our missions worldwide. We are backed by top-tier investors in the frontier-tech and sustainability sectors, including Social Capital, Capricorn, Lux Capital, BOND Capital, and Emerson Collective.
 This is an exciting opportunity with a fast-growing team at the cutting-edge intersection of big data services and autonomous hardware. You will be an integral part of a high-performing multi-disciplinary delivering high impact for humanity and future generations.

 The Role
 This position will work closely with a team (or teams) of engineers, product managers, and leadership to plan and execute software roadmaps for code running onboard Saildrones or in the cloud. You’ll work closely with all parties involved - managing engineers directly, cultivating career growth, marshalling and tracking work for engineering teams through to completion each sprint. You’ll also be coordinating with other managers and leads to lay a course for future work and resourcing on a quarterly basis.
 Required Skills
 This Engineering Manager will be working closely with a highly technical stack of software, so command of software engineering is a prerequisite. Not merely tracking work, this person will need to help the team make good software design decisions. We are looking for a candidate who has transitioned their career from software engineering to software management.
 Strong candidates will either have prior experience in compiled languages (C, C++) and ARM architectures, or server-side languages and UI frameworks (Python, NodeJS, React) and comfort with modern cloud infrastructure technologies (Kubernetes, AWS, Git, CircleCI, etc).
 While current software engineers looking to make the transition to management will be considered, a demonstrated track record leading teams of engineers is preferred.
 An ability to work collaboratively with other managers, making sacrifices to achieve common goals, and the compassion and patience found in excellent people managers is required.

 Minimum Experience
 2-5 years software engineering management
 5-10 years software development prior
 Desired Skills
 Experience with modern agile software management suites like Jira would be advantageous.

 Location: This position is in Alameda, CA. Only candidates with proper permits to work in the United States can be considered. Our waterfront office offers beautiful views of San Francisco Bay in always sunny Alameda. Even our walls have good karma, our offices mix software development with a hardware production line in the former airplane hangar used to film 'The Matrix'.
 Benefits:

 Medical, dental and vision plans for you and your dependents.
 Short and relaxing ferry ride from the Ferry Building for SF residents
 Enhanced paternity / maternity programs
 Competitive benefits including excellent medical, life insurance, 401k plan

  Company Description
   Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.
 Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.
 There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

 You Will:

 About Us:

We're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.

We've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.

About The Role:

Millions of people use Notion — and this number is increasing every day. That means millions of people trust us to keep their data secure and private, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion.

The Trust team is a new engineering team tasked with designing systems to protect Notion’s community. As a founding engineer on the team, you'll partner with our Trust & Safety operations team to anticipate ever-evolving attack vectors and build the technical foundation of a trusted user experience to guide Notion through the next few years of growth.

What You'll Achieve:
Build vision and roadmaps for this team
Protect Notion’s community from account takeovers, phishing, objectionable content, spam and other kinds of fraud and abuse
Articulate Notion’s overall approach and philosophy on privacy
Partner closely with Trust and Safety ops to manage incidents, deep dive on new attack vectors, and improve ops tooling and automation
Partner with the security engineering team to harden access to Notion’s user accounts, such as through 2 factor authentication and systems for detecting fraudulent activity
Built data pipeline, models, and systems to detect anomalies and mitigate potential fraud and abuse
Skills You'll Need to Bring:
Trust expertise: You bring multiple years of software engineering experience in the areas of trust, safety, and abuse prevention.
Startup mentality: You are comfortable navigating the fast moving, unstructured nature of a hyper-growth startup. You are self-motivated to add value and bias towards action. You understand the importance of setting the engineering quality bar for the long term success of our business, but are able to make difficult prioritizations.
Pragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.
Nice to Haves:
Experience in scaling a hyper-growth startup
Experience with mitigating scraper activity or more subtle forms of abuse / terms of service violation
You can lead a small team and multi-month project end to end with minimal management and cross-functional support
You've managed, maintained, and monitored systems using Amazon Web Services, Datadog, Postgres, Redis, Memcached, and Elasticsearch.

Our customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.

Notion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic.

Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.

Because we are still small, it means everyone is a generalist and allows for our engineers to take on multiple roles and challenges not narrowly defined by titles. Regardless of who you are on the engineering team, you will contribute to and have a big impact on the final product from day one. The opportunity for growth and development here is incredible. We have a strong culture of mentoring and promoting from within! We place a lot of emphasis on good engineering practices while retaining the flexibility of allowing each engineering team to have independent agile processes. Diversity is important to us, and we treat each other with respect and empathy.

 About Anomalo

Much like software before it, data is the next competitive battleground for modern enterprises. As a result, more and more companies are rushing to stand up their data stack and become data-powered organizations.

But every data-powered company quickly encounters one unfortunate fact: much of their data is missing, stale, corrupt, or prone to unexpected and unwelcome changes. As a result, companies spend more time dealing with issues in their data rather than unlocking that data's value.

Anomalo addresses this problem by adding a new layer to the Modern Data Stack: a Data Quality Platform that monitors enterprise data to automatically detect and root-cause any data issues, thus allowing teams to resolve any hiccups with their data before making decisions, running operations, or powering models.

We help companies trust the data they use to make decisions and build products.

We work with some of the biggest brands like BuzzFeed, Discover Financial Services, and Substack. We're raised over $39m in seed and Series A funding backed by top-tier venture firms like Norwest Venture Partners, Foundation Capital, Two Sigma Ventures, and First Round Capital. We are building the platform that data-driven companies need to stay data-driven, and would love to have you join us for the ride!
What you'll do as a Front End Engineer at Anomalo:
Own end-to-end development of new product features alongside product and design
Translate designs, sketches, and product ideas into functional and reusable UI components that are beautiful and delightful to use
Maintain Anomalo's React-powered front end platform to ensure usability, scalability, and maintainability
Interact with end-users to deeply understand their needs and build the right solution
Build and maintain a reusable and well-tested component library
Continuously improve our front end tooling and infrastructure to improve developer experience and code quality
Qualifications you'll ideally have:
5+ years of experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript
2+ years of experience with React
Passion for great user experience and design
Experience designing, building, and maintaining scalable front-end systems
Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science or a related discipline or equivalent practical experience
Nice to have:
Python and Django experience
Experience with modern visualization frameworks
Front end experience on a SaaS or Data product
Familiarity with server-side web technologies
Technologies we use:
Python (django / celery / numpy / pandas)
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet / Greykite)
JavaScript (React / Hooks / TypeScript)
Databases (Postgres / Redis / DynamoDB)
Cloud (AWS - EC2, RDS, ECS, S3 / GCP / Azure)
CI/CD (AWS CodeBuild / GitHub Actions)
Containers (Docker / Kubernetes)
Data warehouses (Snowflake / BigQuery / Redshift / Presto / Synapse / DeltaLake)
Perks of working with us

‍ We were fully remote before it was a thing, your best work happens on your schedule
✈️ Unlimited vacation that we encourage you to take
 Top of the line family-friendly medical, dental, and vision insurance plans
 16 weeks paid maternity/paternity leave because family comes first
 A radically open and transparent culture that supports autonomy and growth
 Meaningful employee equity packages plus life insurance and a 401k plan

The Opioid Epidemic is a public health crisis with a highly effective but underutilized clinical intervention - millions of Americans are physically dependent on Opioids but only 10% of those likely to have OUD actually access treatment. Bicycle Health addresses this gap by maximizing accessibility, affordability, and overall quality of care by enabling highly qualified clinicians to reach patients broadly and efficiently through our online platform.

 To disrupt the status quo for opioid use disorder treatment at scale, we are building novel tools that identify the highest risk patients and customize their treatment plan. We are powering these tools with what we aim to be the largest structured clinical dataset for patients with Opioid Use Disorder. You will be responsible for enhancing and maintaining the provider and operations web app and backend to deliver the highest quality of care possible for our patients. The backend integrates with and extends an existing EHR to streamline patient care. The features you build will minimize patient relapse and help people break free from the cycle of opioid dependency.
 Our tech stack: Typescript, React, GraphQL (Apollo), Node.js, Next.js, Tailwind, Google Cloud, App Engine, Cloud Functions, Cloud Firestore, Big Query

Work across the stack, doing anything it takes to solve problems, and see projects through to completion.
Uphold our high engineering standards and bring consistency to the codebases and processes you will encounter.
Be 100% remote. Work from anywhere; your office is wherever you are.

What you'll Need:

2+ years of experience being a technical lead / team lead for a team of senior and junior full stack / backend developers
5+ years of experience building, shipping, and maintaining highly scalable web applications and backend services
Experience developing tech stacks in the cloud: GCP, AWS, or Azure
Experience developing in Typescript, React, and Node.js
Experience building and maintaining multiple applications with large user bases
Experience designing and implementing end-to-end solutions for large-scale features
Experience with API and data persistence layer design and implementation
Experience writing testable code and deep knowledge of testing best practices
Bachelor's degree in Computer Sciences or equivalent experience
A passion for improving the healthcare experience and helping those suffering from opioid use disorder.
A track record of strong ownership, initiative, tenacity, integrity, and humility.
Ability to break big projects into small, testable pieces to consistently hit business-meaningful milestones.
An understanding of the business impact of projects you build and the ability to prioritize projects by balancing between craft, speed, and the bottom line.
Placing a high value on collaboration, knowing that we can be better as a team than as individuals.
Think critically about the implications of what you're building and how it shapes real people's lives.

What would set you apart:

Healthcare industry experience.
Experience building and scaling up multiple applications from the ground up.
Experience with GraphQL, GCP including Cloud Firestore, React Native, Terraform, and HIPAA compliance

Compensation and Benefits:

Competitive compensation and benefits (Medical, Dental and Vision).
401k

 About Anomalo

Much like software before it, data is the next competitive battleground for modern enterprises. As a result, more and more companies are rushing to stand up their data stack and become data-powered organizations.

But every data-powered company quickly encounters one unfortunate fact: much of their data is missing, stale, corrupt, or prone to unexpected and unwelcome changes. As a result, companies spend more time dealing with issues in their data rather than unlocking that data's value.

Anomalo addresses this problem by adding a new layer to the Modern Data Stack: a Data Quality Platform that monitors enterprise data to automatically detect and root-cause any data issues, thus allowing teams to resolve any hiccups with their data before making decisions, running operations, or powering models.

We help companies trust the data they use to make decisions and build products.

We work with some of the biggest brands like BuzzFeed, Discover Financial Services, and Substack. We're raised over $39m in seed and Series A funding backed by top-tier venture firms like Norwest Venture Partners, Foundation Capital, Two Sigma Ventures, and First Round Capital. We are building the platform that data-driven companies need to stay data-driven, and would love to have you join us for the ride!
What you'll do as an Applied Machine Learning Engineer at Anomalo:
Suggest, implement, and own features at the core of Anomalo, which directly impact the customer and allow them to identify, triage, and resolve data quality issues faster
Leverage your machine learning expertise and strong product sense to own and maintain a layer of interpretable machine learning tools built on top of our algorithms
Use explainability algorithms and visualizations to ensure we understand how our algorithms are working in production environments
Build custom visualizations that translate findings from our machine learning algorithms into actionable explanations for issues our customers can easily interpret
Develop new methods and approaches to monitoring or validating data at scale without creating false positive notifications
Expand our library of data checks for constrained anomaly detection and validation use cases
Problem solve and build machine learning products that generalize well on data not directly under our control, from domains ranging from healthcare, to finance, to consumer goods
Directly engage with customers for feedback on features you own so you can not only optimize machine learning algorithms but also experience how they come to life and impact our customers
Qualifications you'll ideally have:
3+ years using machine learning to solve real-world problems
Expertise in statistical modeling, time series analysis and data visualizations
Strong proficiency in Python, pandas, SQL
Ability to distill complex machine learning concepts into interpretable and actionable insights
Bachelor's degree or higher in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science or a related discipline or equivalent practical experience
Nice to have:
Experience working with and triaging data quality issues
Experience with anomaly detection and data analytics
Prior full-stack engineering experience
Technologies we use:
Python (django / celery / numpy / pandas)
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet / Greykite)
JavaScript (React / Hooks / TypeScript)
Databases (Postgres / Redis / DynamoDB)
Cloud (AWS - EC2, RDS, ECS, S3 / GCP / Azure)
CI/CD (AWS CodeBuild / GitHub Actions)
Containers (Docker / Kubernetes)
Data warehouses (Snowflake / BigQuery / Redshift / Presto / Synapse / DeltaLake)
Perks of working with us

‍ We were fully remote before it was a thing, your best work happens on your schedule
✈️ Unlimited vacation that we encourage you to take
 Top of the line family-friendly medical, dental, and vision insurance plans
 16 weeks paid maternity/paternity leave because family comes first
 A radically open and transparent culture that supports autonomy and growth
 Meaningful employee equity packages plus life insurance and a 401k plan
️ All new top-of-the-line laptops, monitors, and peripherals for doing your best work

What we value

Rational Optimism - We rely on each other to make principled decisions backed by data and logic
For & By All - Diverse, inclusive teams build better products that represent the needs of our customers
Own It - We champion ownership, and we take accountability for our work
Opacity Zero - Transparency enables our autonomous and fact-driven culture
Outcomes > Hours - People should work when and where they will be most productive

 Who we are

Samsara (NYSE: IOT) is the pioneer of the Connected Operations Cloud, which allows businesses that depend on physical operations to harness IoT (Internet of Things) data to develop actionable business insights and improve their operations. Founded in San Francisco in 2015, we now employ more than 1,600 people globally and have over 1.5 million active devices. Samsara also went public in December 2021 and we're just getting started.

#2 in the Financial Times' Fastest Growing Companies in Americas list 2021
Named as a Best Place to Work in Built In 2022
#19 in the Forbes Cloud 100 2021
IoT Analytics Company of the Year in 2022's IoT Breakthrough Winners
Forbes Advisor named us the Best Solution for Large Companies - Fleet management software for 2022!

We're driving change in industries that are yet to fully embrace digital transformation. Physical operations make up a massive slice of the global economy but haven't benefited from innovation and actionable information in the way that other sectors have. The potential for scale and impact is huge.
About the role:

The Driver App and Mobile Infrastructure team is an integral part of our Fleet Applications / Connected Driver division. Our driver app serves over 100k drivers every day, and we're excited to enter a new stage of growth and maturity as we scale 10x to 1M daily active users. We are both a user-facing feature team and an infrastructure team. Our user-facing features form the core driver experience upon which many other features (Routing, Docs, Messaging, Safety, Compliance) are built upon. Our team also builds a wide variety of infrastructure, including reusable UX components and design systems, SDKs, continuous integration systems, monitoring tools, and networking and persistence layer frameworks. The infrastructure we build is leveraged across multiple apps and business divisions (Fleet, Industrial, and Connected Sites), so our team's impact across the company is far-reaching.

We use React Native, Typescript, Redux, and GraphQL for our mobile apps, and Golang for our backend. Direct experience with these technologies is not required. This position can be office based or fully remote.

In this role, you will:
Collaborate with product, design, and other engineering teams to build new and innovative application experiences for our mobile apps.
Build the next generation of UX design systems for our mobile apps.
Streamline developer experience by improving the efficiency and resiliency of our continuous integration systems, monitoring tools, and core development platform.
Champion, role model, and embed Samsara's cultural principles (Focus on Customer Success, Build for the Long Term, Adopt a Growth Mindset, Be Inclusive, Win as a Team) as we scale globally and across new offices.

Minimum requirements for the role:

Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science/Engineering or equivalent practical experience
Has 4+ years of relevant industry experience in software development
Strong programming/coding fundamentals

An ideal candidate also has:

Has 2+ years of experience on full-stack or infrastructure-focused teams
Has built production web applications using React or mobile applications using either Native or React Native frameworks
Enjoys thinking about systems - their life cycles, edge cases, interactions, and failure modes
Enjoys understanding customer needs and finding how to make their processes easier to manage
Loves shipping features that are immediately used by our customers
Seeks to iterate on new products based on customer feedback

 Who we are

Kentik is the network observability company. Our platform is a must-have for the network front line, whether digital business, corporate IT, or service provider. Network professionals turn to the Kentik Network Observability Cloud to plan, run, and fix any network, relying on our infinite granularity, AI-driven insights, and insanely fast search.

Kentik makes sense of network, cloud, host, and container flow, Internet routing, performance tests, and network metrics. We show network pros what they need to know about their network performance, health, and security to make their business-critical services shine. Networks power the world's most valuable companies, and those companies trust Kentik. Market leaders like IBM, Box, and Zoom rely on Kentik for network observability. Visit us at kentik.com and follow us at @kentikinc.
About the role

The Rapid Application Development (RAD) team works on speculative projects to explore new ideas to expand what Kentik can do for customers as well as behind-the-scenes platform enhancements to improve efficiency, scalability, reliability, and maintainability. On the RAD team, we aim to learn by building, gathering feedback, and iterating quickly to prove (or disprove!) the value of a concept.

The purpose of a RAD project is to assess the feasibility of the idea, uncover hidden challenges, and, for marketable features, produce a prototype that the product team can use to validate the market value of the concept. This effort will also enable us to create an informed project plan for a complete, production-ready version.

As a UI engineer on the RAD team, you will build innovative user interfaces for these projects, both visual and programmatic, working closely with the rest of the RAD team to help users gain new insights and solve problems in their networks.

We have built a team of world-class engineers, network experts, and influential technologists in a remote-first culture from day one. While prior experience in a remote environment is not required, we highly value strong collaboration and communication skills, as well as a high level of independence and autonomy.

Some working hours in US time zones are strongly preferred.

What to expect
A high degree of autonomy in developing state-of-the-art UIs
Working in a small team to prototype new product and platform features
Participating in peer code review
Working on high-visibility, challenging engineering problems
Regular collaboration with other development teams and our technical operations group
You may be a good fit if you have
Passion for pixel perfect, highly interactive user experiences
The ability to efficiently debug and solve issues
Deep experience with React, HTML and CSS
Expertise in vanilla JavaScript / understanding of high performance JavaScript patterns
Experience with data analytics and data visualization
Experience with production Node.js (express)
A solid understanding of SQL syntax, especially with PostgreSQL and MySQL
Our tech stack
Our core data engine and platform are primarily written in Go
We use Node.js + Express for application serving, and React as our primary UI framework
We also use some JS and Python for tooling/scripting
In addition to our own database, we use Postgres, Kafka, Mysql, and Redis
Internal and public APIs expose both rest/json and gRPC endpoints
Haproxy, Envoy for API traffic routing and balancing
Github for source control, PRs, issues
Jenkins for automated builds
Perks*
100% company-paid health insurance for you and your dependents
Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) for you and your dependents
Dependent Care Flexible Spending Account (DCFSA)

Vanguard 401(k)
Flexible time off

Come work with us
The true meaning of Kentik is visibility. We're committed to making sure everyone feels empowered to use their voice, has a sense of belonging, and is represented at Kentik.

  Company Description
   Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.
 Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.
 There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.



  Job Description
   When we launched the little white reader, we invented mobile, ubiquitous payments and enabled anyone to start, run, and grow a business. Ten years and billions of transactions later we're re-imagining commerce for businesses of all types and sizes—we're helping the independent electrician send invoices, helping the beauty salon pay its employees, and giving the burgeoning coffee chain capital for a second, third, and fourth location. We're working to find new and better ways to help businesses succeed on their own terms—and we're looking for people like you to help shape tomorrow at Square.
 Much in the same way that Square revolutionized payments, we want to radically alter how employees get paid and businesses manage their finances. Our mission is to make running a business simple and personal by applying automation and an excellent user-experience. Our small collaborative team has already built many foundational features and are now focused on improving and experimenting beyond a traditional payroll product. We want to transform the lives of people that make their living through our platform. We're a growing part of the Square ecosystem and are using our position to build products and features that are beyond the capabilities of our competitors.
 We are an expanding team with an abundance of growth and influence opportunities. We are building the best full featured payroll solution for small businesses with an emphasis on design and automation. At the same time we are doing this in an organized and scalable way, making smart choices about how to automate important functions.
 You Will:

 Work with other engineers, designers, and product managers to develop features from prototype to launch.
 Oversee the entirety of your features; including component design, implementation, automated testing, and roll-out.
 Provide technical guidance to an amazing group of engineers, and teach us front-end development best practices.
 Contribute to the leadership, stewardship, planning, and evangelism of our modern React-based front-end architecture, which has achieved several firsts within the Square front-end community.
 Build systems that collect and maintain customers sensitive data, while holding Square to the highest standards for security and compliance.
 Stay curious, ask questions when you need help, and have a voice in the future of our road-map.




  Qualifications
   You Have:

 Excellent software engineering knowledge and the ability to provide technical mentorship and guidance.
 The ability to work with other roles such as designers, product managers, data scientists, marketing, and business development, to bring together a great experience-driven product.

 About Anomalo

Much like software before it, data is the next competitive battleground for modern enterprises. As a result, more and more companies are rushing to stand up their data stack and become data-powered organizations.

But every data-powered company quickly encounters one unfortunate fact: much of their data is missing, stale, corrupt, or prone to unexpected and unwelcome changes. As a result, companies spend more time dealing with issues in their data rather than unlocking that data's value.

Anomalo addresses this problem by adding a new layer to the Modern Data Stack: a Data Quality Platform that monitors enterprise data to automatically detect and root-cause any data issues, thus allowing teams to resolve any hiccups with their data before making decisions, running operations, or powering models.

We help companies trust the data they use to make decisions and build products.

We work with some of the biggest brands like BuzzFeed, Discover Financial Services, and Substack. We're raised over $39m in seed and Series A funding backed by top-tier venture firms like Norwest Venture Partners, Foundation Capital, Two Sigma Ventures, and First Round Capital. We are building the platform that data-driven companies need to stay data-driven, and would love to have you join us for the ride!
What you'll do as a Full Stack Engineer at Anomalo:
Own end-to-end development of product features (ideation, architecture, frontend/backend development, and ongoing operations) alongside product and design
Support, improve and expand on our existing data warehouse integrations
Improve and maintain our test and CI/CD infrastructure
Manage the operations of our cloud infrastructure
Architect systems that can be deployed and maintained both within our cloud environments and our customers' own networks
Define the data model across our backend data sources
Instrument and optimize the performance of our machine learning pipeline alongside machine learning engineering
Improve and maintain our customer deployment pipeline and experience
Support our existing platform integrations (Slack API / Google OAuth / etc.) and build out new integrations
Integrate observability into our systems that we can quickly understand the health of our systems, including internal systems and externally-deployed instances of our system
Architect, build, and maintain our cloud infrastructure security model
Qualifications you'll ideally have:
5+ years of software development or equivalent experience
Proficiency in Python is highly preferred.
Desire and ability to work at multiple levels of the stack (frontend, backend, SRE)
Strong knowledge of SQL
Bachelor's degree or higher in Computer Science or a related discipline or equivalent practical experience
Nice to have:
Experience with architecting, deploying, and maintaining hybrid cloud software
Familiarity with modern front-end web development
Prior experience working with machine learning/data science teams and complex ML pipelines
Technologies we use:
Python (django / celery / numpy / pandas)
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet / Greykite)
JavaScript (React / Hooks / TypeScript)
Databases (Postgres / Redis / DynamoDB)
Cloud (AWS - EC2, RDS, ECS, S3 / GCP / Azure)
CI/CD (AWS CodeBuild / GitHub Actions)
Containers (Docker / Kubernetes)
Data warehouses (Snowflake / BigQuery / Redshift / Presto / Synapse / DeltaLake)
Perks of working with us

 About the company:

Founded by ex-Apple Product and Engineering leaders, Level is redefining the smart home with technology that is simple, intuitive, useful, and invisible. We recently raised a $100M C round and we're looking to grow our engineering team.

At Level, we take a unique approach to designing products - one that shifts focus from what we make to how we make it and who we make it for. It's an approach that results in elegant and unique solutions, raising the bar for the entire smart home ecosystem.

It's also an approach that has led to our partnerships with Apple, Amazon (including Ring integration), Walmart, and other industry leaders – assuring that our products provide solutions that align with the technology choices and preferences of our customers.


About the role:

We're looking to add a Senior Server-side (Backend) developer to our engineering team. If you're interested in solving complex problems associated with providing a Smart Home experience to others and scaling an application to handle hundreds of thousands to millions of events a day, as well as working in an open, diverse, and inclusive environment, Level Home could be an ideal fit for your career. We've had tremendous growth in the past few years and we have an exciting roadmap ahead of us.

We look for strategic thinkers and creative problem solvers with a bias for execution and we'll expect you to contribute code as well as product/feature ideas from the get-go.


Our technology stack features languages like Python and Rust. Hand in hand with technologies like AWS SNS, Lambda and EKS which allows us to gain data integrity across the platform. We also use common relational solutions such as RDS and Aurora.

Responsibilities:

Architect, design, and implement backend services including the core API, backend data processing, and vendor integrations.
Own the end to end delivery of software from inception to production
Instrument, test, profile, and code review software
Continuously deploy to our cloud-based infrastructure
Scale software infrastructure for a quickly-growing user base

Required Qualifications:

5+ years of experience architecting/designing and deploying server-side API's and backend applications written in Go, Java and/or Python
Experience working with SQL and/or NoSQL databases
Excellent communication and collaboration skills
Experience with event-based architectures
Creative problem solver with a passion for testing, debugging, and overall code quality
Data-driven decision maker, willing to take risks, fail fast, and iterate quickly
Strong software engineering best practices (e.g. unit testing, code reviews, design documentation).
Experience turning ideas into reliable code that others find easy to understand and modify
Bachelor's degree in computer science, Engineering, Management Information Systems, another related field or its equivalent.
You have a strong sense of ownership, and a curiosity to understand how things work, even if that requires going outside your area of expertise


More about Level Home:

When we look around our homes today, we see opportunity. We see "smart" products that lack utility and connected devices that push us further apart. We see consumers with high expectations, current standards set too low, and products that simply fail to deliver.

Level Home Inc. is re-inventing the standard. We're redefining "smart", to center around thoughtfulness, practicality, and the people who make the problem worth solving. We approach product design with a blank slate, zero assumptions, and an open-mind, because the way a problem is defined sets the stage for its solution. We couple deep expertise with unbridled curiosity, because to us "smart" means simple, intuitive, and useful.

We start with empathy, take new perspectives, and challenge existing standards. People are at the heart of what we do, and respecting their style, choices, and preferences is the first step to uncovering a thoughtful solution that truly improves their daily lives. After all, we're not just designing products for a house, we are designing them for the people who make it a home.

Level Home Inc. is an Equal Opportunity Employer and all qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, disability or genetic information, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or national origin.

A note to Recruitment Agencies: Please don't reach out to Level employees or leaders about our roles - we've got Recruiting covered. We don't accept unsolicited agency resumes and we are not responsible for any fees related to unsolicited resumes. Thank you for your understanding.

CloudHealth by VMware is the global market leader in Cloud Management, and the most trusted software platform used to accelerate business transformation in the cloud. CloudHealth by VMware is looking for highly motivated individuals who will be responsible for providing outstanding customer service to ensure that customers, partners, and employees have a positive experience getting onboarding and ongoing training from CloudHealth.

 The Elevator Pitch: Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?
 You have an analytical mind and a passion for the craft of software engineering, and you love solving problems and learning new things. Technologies come and go, but that excites you because of the endless possibilities it creates. You are looking for an opportunity to work for a company whose software is utilized by every Fortune 500 company and significantly impacts every industry. You want to be a part of a collaborative environment whose teams care about the product they are creating, how they create it, and the impact it has on customers’ business objectives.

 What is primary need, technical challenge, and/or problem you will be responsible for? 
Our microservices engineering team is responsible for the architecture, design, and implementation of common services for our new platform. The CloudHealth platform manages data from multiple cloud providers in support of our 10,000+ customers. Our microservices team is developing a scalable platform to be consumed by our customers, partners, integrators, and CloudHealth feature engineering teams.
 This team is leveraging the latest technologies to build reusable core services and a data pipeline that must be secure, scalable, reliable, available, and performant. If you are great at solving scale and resiliency problems in a rapidly expanding 24/7 SaaS environment and thrive on the challenges of developing and deploying microservices, this is the team for you.
 Success in the Role: What are the performance goals over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing? 

You will be expected to produce software designs that define CloudHealth’s next generation service API and related infrastructure. These interfaces must meet VMware and industry standards and provide a consistent programming model across multiple programming languages. 
You will define and develop APIs (REST and graphQL), SDKs and CLI interfaces that offer a consistent and secure access point to the CloudHealth platform for both internal and external use cases. You will also deliver automated tests and documentation to support the adoption of these interfaces.
 You will be expected to work closely with other teams within CloudHealth that need to consume core platform features and ensure that their programmatic interface needs are met.
 You will be responsible for designing and delivering the supporting infrastructure functions to deliver your solutions at cloud-scale, including features such as usage tracking, throttling, monitoring and alerting.
 You will be regularly evaluated on the quality of the product you create and the code you write to ensure continued advancement of your technical skills in an environment that looks to expand them. 
As a member of the CloudHealth infrastructure group you will be expected to work with and contribute to its Kubernetes based microservices architecture, and all your deliverables must align with the group’s development and deployment standards.
 Advocate, encourage, and influence innovation and adoption of microservices architecture by being an effective technical leader across development teams.


 What type of work will you be doing? What assignments, requirements, or skills will you be performing on a regular basis? 
As a new member of the Infrastructure Platform Team (aka “Team Atlas”), you will:

 Design and develop software using a microservices architecture, with knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes, in leading cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP) and build frameworks for other teams to follow your path
 Work with the team and product management to build delivery requirements
 Write technical design documents and hold reviews
 Participate in all team scrum ceremonies
 Develop and maintain software that delivers on the team’s objectives primarily in Java and Scala, and, infrequently, in Ruby or Golang
 Deploy microservices to Kubernetes using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) systems
 Participate in our on-call rotation, providing operational support to our platform
 Communicate with internal consumers of the team’s software and gather requirements and facilitate adoption of your solutions


 What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?
 This position reports to the Manager of the CloudHealth Platform Team (aka “Team Atlas”), an experienced software engineer and manager who joined CloudHealth as an engineer in 2017. The team consists of highly competent senior engineers. We focus on iterative development, both of software and our software development practices.
 You will initially be part an established team that has a wide range of core platform responsibilities, but the expectation is that you will help harden and evolve our Kubernetes-based development platform. This position is focused on making CloudHealth engineers more efficient by paving a path using components that our teams can use “off-the-shelf” to solve complex problems like CI/CD, inter-service communication, GraphQL API specifications, and others. This is a great opportunity to work with leading-edge technologies, experiment with new ways to build software, and provide critical supporting software to fellow engineers.

 This job may require the candidate to travel and/or work from a facility that requires full vaccination prior to entry.

Company Description  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.


  Job Description
   As an MLE within the Measurement ML team, you will work collaboratively to apply novel machine learning algorithms and data science methods toward new products that empower our internal business stakeholders. The Measurement team quantifies the impact of Square’s business initiatives through machine learning models in areas such as marketing attribution modeling and forecasting value estimation. We empower stakeholders in marketing, finance, and strategy to make data-driven decisions that will help Square grow.
 Measurement ML is part of the Decision Sciences team. We partner with business, product, operations, and engineering teams to guide better decisions using machine learning. We’re a passionate team of specialists, statisticians, and optimizers who are resourceful in distilling questions, wrangling data and driving impactful business decisions.



  Qualifications
   You Will:

 Collaborate with machine learning engineers and data scientists to train, deploy, and test machine learning models using state-of-the-art techniques.
 Help build the next generation of data products at Square by leveraging ML techniques such as: time series forecasting techniques, causal inference, propensity modeling

 You Have:

 4 - 7 years of relevant education or industry experience in data science, machine learning, computer science, statistics, or a similar field.
 Ability to produce scalable and robust production-quality code incorporating testing, evaluation, and monitoring.
 Experience in designing and productionizing large-scale distributed systems built around machine learning models and big data.
 Experience with cloud computing platforms is preferred (i.e. Google Cloud Platform)
 Experience with growth (acquisition, engagement, retention) and modeling on marketing data (i.e. attribution, propensity to convert, customer journey mapping, lifetime value, incrementality) is a plus.

 Technologies we use:

 Python, Google Cloud Platform, Snowflake, Airflow

 Additional Information
  
 We’re working to build a more inclusive economy where our customers have equal access to opportunity, and we strive to live by these same values in building our workplace.

Who You AreYou're a hands-on engineer energized by ownership of your design decisions. You understand how every mechanical part you design, every fitting you specify, and every line of code you write is a commitment. You're thorough and don't leave loose ends dangling. You're excited when the things you build outlast you. You excel at translating loosely-defined scientific requests into rigorous, deterministic machines that help unlock technical truth. You bring pragmatism and a daily sense of urgency to your work. When you see hardware in the wild, you always wonder, "could I build this better?" When things don't go as planned, you excel at reducing problems to their underlying physical phenomena and finding solutions everyone can trust. You're a skilled listener and communicator, which helps you interface with a wide range of people, from chemists to pipe fitters. You're relentless in eliminating sources of drift and uncertainty.Responsibilities & Duties

Design and build new R&D hardware (and the software and instrumentation that runs it). Starting from a blank sheet of paper, deliver new-to-the-world reactors comprising wet chemistry, thermal processes, instrumentation, and tightly-integrated process automation.

Work with contractors and external vendors to get things built. This will include fabricators, tradespeople, system integrators, and in-house engineers & technicians.
Close loops. In daily collaboration with the end-users of the machines you build, iterate and refine your designs in fast learning cycles.
Diagnose problems when they arise and fix them responsively. This will include data analysis and in-person discussions with people who identify problems.
Organize, document, communicate. Create enduring records of your work. Ensure successful handoff to end-users of your work with clearly-documented commissioning procedures and tests.
Bring the right level of operational discipline to an open-ended R&D setting. Plan projects accurately and execute according to plan. Design hardware for manufacturability and operability.

Knowledge & Skill Requirements

BS in engineering and at least 5 years of work experience (or fewer for candidates with an advanced degree).
Frictionless proficiency in mechanical design, CAD software (SolidWorks preferred), and making machines that balance flexibility and robustness. Proficiency in documenting designs and getting them fabricated by outside vendors.
Programming experience (C, Python, .NET, or IEC 61131 PLC automation preferred).
Knowledge of AC and DC power fundamentals, sensor/signal troubleshooting, and field wiring best practices.
Experience with complex, multidisciplinary technical systems (for instance: interconnected electronic, mechanical, pneumatic, and hydraulic systems)
Great communication skills, including the ability to surface problems constructively.
Experience in R&D settings with time pressure, open-ended technical problems, and substantial individual autonomy are nice to have

Physical Demands & Working Conditions

Pass a respirator fit test and be able to wear respiratory protection on a periodic basis
Wear personal protective equipment including, but not limited to, a lab coat, gloves, safety glasses, and steel toe safety shoes
Move items up to 50 lbs with the assistance of lift equipment and carts

Job Type: Full-time
