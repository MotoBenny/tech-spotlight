Company Description  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.


  Job Description
   Merchants hire the Help Experience Team to provide them the right solutions at the right time to ensure they continue to be successful with their business.
 As a software engineer on this team, you'll be a part of evolving our support products for Square's millions of merchants. We leverage experimentation, personalization, recommendation relevancy, and more to ensure that we route sellers to the right help experiences at the right time according to their unique needs. We must do this with technical sustainability and scale in mind for our merchants and teams at Square to benefit from our work.



  Qualifications
   You will...

 Be exposed to and impact real business challenges.
 Identify and explore ways to improve application architecture, testing, and building pipeline.

 You’ll need to…

 Be proficient in building web apps and large-scale applications.
 Build with modern front-end and server-side technologies and frameworks

As an Etsy employee, you'll tackle unique problems alongside talented coworkers committed to Keeping Commerce Human. We're large enough that you'll focus on meaningful, complex challenges, but small enough that you can make a rewarding impact.

 Identifying opportunities to improve our architecture, operability or capabilities

 You enjoy writing technical documentation
 You care deeply about performance and usability on a variety of devices

Hi,
I’m John, the President of Site Steward, a WordPress support services company.
We have a 9 month WordPress developer apprenticeship designed for people with no experience.
It's an outstanding opportunity to take a big step in your career. The basic idea is that rather than flip burgers or work in jobs that don't offer much in the form of a career, you do a paid nine-month apprenticeship that provides you the skills you need to take an entry-level job in web development.
It's great for someone like you with a technical interest and mixes dedicated training with real-world application.
At the end of the nine months, you'll be a developer with two certifications from Duke University and WC3, the nonprofit that governs standards for the Internet. You'll have also learned the most popular content management application on the Internet.
As part of the apprenticeship, you'll also develop professional skills, giving you an advantage in future job interviews and setting you up for long-term success.
On top of all this, you'll finish the apprenticeship with a real-world portfolio of work and a letter of recommendation.
Even if you don't currently have a computer or a space to work- it's okay. The people running the program will get you access to both a computer and space to work. Because it's a remote program you can do it from anywhere.
All they're looking for is a self-starter with good reading and writing skills who can commit to nine months of work.
It's important to understand that this is an apprenticeship where you have to pay your dues starting at the bottom. A willingness to do the grunt work and have a good attitude is a must. But this grunt work will give you a solid foundation to build into more complicated challenges.
This is a big opportunity to put you on a career path that leads to financial success.

About Cambium Carbon
 Thirty-six million trees fall in U.S. cities each year, more than all the salvageable wood in our national forests and they're often wasted and sent to landfills! At Cambium Carbon, we use technology to build local wood supply chains – we save fallen trees from landfills by connecting them to local sawyers and millers who can turn them into durable products storing carbon for generations and funding tree planting in communities that need them most.

 We plan to scale into other materials and are focused on being the leading circular economy platform.

Philo: TV on the Internet (TVoIP)At Philo, we’re a group of technology and product people who set out to build the future of television, marrying the best in modern technology with the most compelling medium ever invented — in short, we’re building the TV experience that we’ve always wanted for ourselves.

This technology is also the building block for upcoming co-viewing features.
Building a generic focus management framework that we think simplifies a lot of the gaps in system focus, and is much lighter-weight than leanback's GridView. It is a set of custom views that delegate focusSearch and onRequestFocusInDescendants. We hope to open source this library very soon!
Starting to build out Kotlin Multi Platform libraries to share code between our iOS and Android apps.
Developing our own lightweight MVI framework that we built on top of RX, which we are now starting to port over to coroutines.

Make Work Better Every Day




    Quantum Workplace, an HR technology provider, equips workplaces with the smartest talent solutions so that they can grow and succeed. We pioneered some of the earliest employee engagement and performance software and have since partnered with thousands of organizations to drive employee, team, and business success.
  



    We’re in the business of creating awesome work environments—and are committed to being one also. We are smart people who care deeply about what we do. We work hard but laugh harder. We wear casual clothes, work flexible hours, and get stuff done. You’ll love it here.
  


 What’s the opportunity?


    We are searching for Full Stack Software Engineers to join our team in Omaha. You enjoy being surrounded by talented engineers to learn and challenge each other.
  



    You believe engineers should be involved much earlier in the process than when it's time to code (although that is pretty fun). You’d prefer to sit in on customer interviews, design sprints, early non-dev prototypes, and throw on some noise cancelling headphones when it's time to build. You strive to build beautiful, usable software, and if you aren't the type to wear your beret hat you are encouraged to work with the product designer who is a full-time resource for your team.
  



    We use our own flavor of agile processes to get things done. We use Git and an automated CI setup for builds and Octopus for shipping code to testing environments and to production. We review each other’s pull requests. We believe in automation over repetition and aim to make our code and infrastructure more scalable.
  
 Responsibilities 

Write awesome code
 Work with large, complex datasets
 Collaborate with product team to bring prototypes to production

 Qualifications

 1+ years of professional experience building software
 Must be able to work in the U.S. without sponsorship
 We're not interested in a checklist of experiences, but here is a list of things we use: .NET, C#, Flutter, Dart, SQL Server, Redis, Hangfire, Azure, IdentityServer, Sass, and probably a few more things.
 Bottom line: you need to be stellar. If you are grouchy, too political, or don’t admit mistakes, you will hate it here.


 Why Quantum Workplace?



 Health Insurance: We offer 3 options (1 option is 100% premium paid by QW for employees) + Telehealth
Dental & Vision: We cover 100% of premiums for employees
401k: We match 100% of contributions up to 4% and you're fully vested on Day 1

    First and foremost, Kyruuvians care deeply about our vision to enable human beings to care for human beings, our mission, and our CORE values:
   


 Caring – We care about doing the right thing, in the right way, every time.
Ownership – We own both our successes and our mistakes, taking responsibility and always learning how to be better.
Respect – We respect and celebrate the individual traits that enable each of us, our customers, our providers, and our patients, to be the best that we can be.
Empowerment – We embrace a culture that supports everyone’s ability to contribute and lead.



 Here’s what that would mean for you in the 
    Software Engineer I role.
   



Caring

 You’ll work closely with customer-facing employees on other teams to understand the needs of our customers, and set up our platform to provide the best experience for them and the patients they serve.





Ownership

 Your typical day will include attending Agile standups, writing configuration files, using internal tools like Jenkins, testing your changes, and reviewing others’ changes. You’ll make improvements to our data pipeline, infrastructure and tools to improve our data processing capabilities for all of our customers. You’ll participate in and contribute to Agile team activities. You’ll triage work assigned to the team, ensure it’s ready to be worked on, and estimate the level of effort. You’ll apply Kyruus’ software engineering best practices, coding standards and patterns for development and deployment. You’ll investigate alerts about possible errors in our system. You’ll help solve outages, participate in retrospectives, and implement countermeasures to prevent similar issues from recurring. You’ll create tools and documentation for internal teams like Delivery to understand how our systems work and to enable them to onboard customers in a timely manner with minimal support from Engineering. You’ll report to the Senior Manager, Engineering in the Customer Onboarding Department within the R&D - Engineering Division.





Respect

 How You’ll Use Your Professional Skills You’ll use your entry level experience (1+ years) and/or education in programming to: Help the Agile team execute on internal and external commitments on time. You’ll use your experience in/familiarity with technologies relevant to Kyruus to: Build, scale, and deliver dynamic and highly-available enterprise solutions. Think creatively about how to use technology and tools to solve problems faced by our users and customers. You’ll use your critical thinking skills to: Escalate issues to your Agile team in a timely manner. Troubleshoot issues and debug code to find the root cause of issues and develop countermeasures to address them.





Empowerment

 How You’ll Know You’re Succeeding You enjoy coding and deliver high-quality, robustly coded, easy-to-reason-about software with your proficiency in Python and ability to use data manipulation tools like JMESPath. You complete your tasks reliably and on time to help the team achieve roadmap goals and customer commits. You test your changes thoroughly to ensure that your solution meets the acceptance criteria and does not introduce bugs. You ask for help when you’re blocked and invest in learning from mentors and seek training opportunities to improve your skills as a software engineer. You are assigned tasks of increasing levels of complexity that you’re able to complete with growing confidence. You contribute to improving your team’s software development and deployment processes and are able to demonstrate a high degree of predictability and accountability in delivering your work. Where You’ll Go From Here Kyruuvians in the Software Engineer I role can move in a linear career path to a Software Engineer II or based on skills, performance, and results accomplished to Senior Software Engineer I position. From the Senior Software Engineer position, you can choose to develop along one of two tracks - individual contributor, as a Principal Software Engineer I, or management, as a Manager, Engineering. Kyruus also loves to see an internal transfer. If a linear career path is not what you’re looking for, you can work with your manager and HR to explore lateral moves to other parts of the organization as you continue to grow with us.

Xochi Interactive is a startup indie company. This will be our first created title; we're looking for a programmer who can take the initiative and work within the game's vision. You'll be implementing the core mechanics into the game such as movement, combat, AI, and dialogue. In addition, you'll work closely with the creative director to ensure the project stays within the scope.
PROJECT

The goal is to create a playable demo with an estimated range of 20-30 minutes of gameplay. The player character will be a knight that is traveling from one kingdom to another in an outdoor environment along a linear path. Enemy encounters will be in open-spaced areas while the paths in between will be more narrow. There will be 3 different enemy types. The demo will feature a small number of collectibles, a companion that follows you, environmental engagement, and cinematic cutscenes.

The priority is optimization with it being all outdoors. We have an ongoing list of our mechanics within a document and a GDD that you'll be given access to. You will be working with marketplace assets to speed up the development process but core features like combat will need to be created manually. The project will use Perforce as its choice of source control. The goal is to create a project everyone on the team is proud of. We are developing a free demo and below is our website that gives a little detail about the project we are developing.
Website: https://xochi-interactive.com/
If you'd like to see what assets you'll be possibly working with search for the assets listed below in Unreal's Marketplace.

Motion Symphony
Hit Trace Detection
Dialogue Plugin
The Targeting System

PAYMENT
Unfortunately, since we are a start-up company the payment isn't as high as we wish we could pay, but I don't want people to work for free. When the programming is complete and bugs have been fixed after playtesting the pay will be $1,500. How the payment is dispersed can be discussed, it can either be at the end or during milestones. We hope to find someone who is just as passionate about the project as the rest of the team.
If the team works together and can push out a well-polished game, we aim to seek funding for the full version. This will hopefully open up future opportunities and allow us to build upon the demo for a full-length game. If you enjoyed working on this project and would like to be a part of the full project, we'd like to keep all team members on board from the demo to the full game if possible.
WHY WORK WITH XOCHI INTERACTIVE?
We support creativity and keep gamers in mind when we work on any type of project. Our goal is to focus on story-driven titles, none of our titles will have microtransactions or DLC. We are adamant about publishing full and complete titles, then moving on to the next project.
If you're interested in building the founding blocks of a project, then this is for you. Starting out, you will be the primary programmer on the project as of right now. We do plan on bringing in a UI programmer to focus on UI-related tasks. The goal is to have the demo completed by late October and QA with bug fixes to be completed by December. To have this wrapped up by Christmas is the goal; however, we did account for issues, so we will not be officially launching Kickstarter until March/April of 2023. This will give us time to gather material from our project to put together and promote.
REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE

Rapid Prototyping
Asset Integration
Familiarity with assets from Unreal Marketplace and the willingness to learn assets that are implemented.
Version Control (Perforce)
Self-motivated & willing to improve a project
Excellent communication
Experience with scripting
Project Management Software (ClickUp, Jira)
Ability to learn new tools to improve gameplay quality/optimization
Positive attitude and willingness to help in any way.

PREFERRED

Portfolio (Showcase previous work)
Shipped titles (Preferred but not required)
Familiarity with Motion Symphony is a plus

If this is a position you're interested in and you'd like to be a part of a passionate team include a cover letter explaining what you can bring to the team and why this is something you're interested in. This will also let me know if you read the full job description and are more interested in the position. Look forward to discussing the project more with you!

Great Team Culture + Benefits

Great opportunity for Full Stack Engineers! Jettison is representing an innovative platform dedicated to providing sales organizations real-time performance insights to create revenue-driving cultures. World-class clients use this platform to create transparent, goal-oriented, and inspired sales teams and call centers. You want to be a part of this exciting and growing team!
ROLE OVERVIEW: 
If you have experience building and maintaining web applications and are looking to make an impact within a scaling startup we'd love to hear from you. Our platform is organized into surfaces that correlate to functionality. For example: Gamification, Coaching, Workflows, Scorecards, Metrics. You will be collaborating with a product team to improve these surfaces to increase end-user value and ultimately, company revenue. We have the privilege of working with several Fortune 500 customers at-scale which means that we must take caching, pagination, and query planning very seriously. It's not uncommon for a code review to point out that a test needs to assert the number of queries generated or that a cache needs to be created to optimize a serializer.
KEY RESPONSIBILITIES: 

Create/modify models to store data
Create/modify API endpoints and serializers to provide access to data
Create/modify frontend components to visualize, interact with data
Operating without an ego. We have nothing to prove to each other here, we care about holding ourselves and each other accountable to great work that we can all be proud of.
Write frontend/backend unit, integration, performance tests
Profile and address performance issues
Do things the right way with a long-term outlook.

Senior Software Engineer at tuuthfairy (remote)
Comp: $80k-$200k, Equity: 0.0% - 0.75%
Full-time
What We Do
tuuthfairy is a software-as-a-service for dentists. Our vision is to make dental care transparent and affordable for all Americans by accelerating the transition to modern payment experience for the $200 billion industry. The current lack of transparency in pricing at dental offices is caused by ‘20 days’ it takes for dental insurances to pay dentists for services rendered. Until this moment, whether a patient’s insurance will cover for a treatment and the amount of coverage is unknown or at best a guesstimate. tuuthfairy is solving this problem by predicting the decision of dental insurances ‘now’ and making this knowledge available via API. tuuthfairy is headquartered in San Mateo, CA in the heart of Silicon Valley.
Who We're Looking For
After a few years of servicing dental providers directly, tuuthfairy is finally availing its service to developers at scale. We are looking for a mission driven candidate who wants to solve hard problems that all Americans face every day. As one of the earliest engineers, you will be a critical part of team building and the cultural backbone of the tech team.

Build our core engineering infrastructure, including new products and features

3+ years of programming experience with at least one modern languages
2+ years of experience contributing to the architecture and design (architecture, design patterns, reliability and scaling) of new and current systems.
Ability to understand how our business functions and how challenges and bottlenecks can be addressed through the engineering team.
Collaborative, team-centric mindset. We are a small but mighty team and everyone must be aligned on our goals.

You'll Really Stand Out If

Experience documenting coding and architectural decisions

Benefits

Best in class healthcare including medical, dental, and vision
Competitive salary and equity packages

tuuthfairy is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We are committed to building a diverse and inclusive culture and celebrate authenticity.

Staff Scala Engineer (Data Pipeline)


 Europe (remote, with UK HQ)



 Who are we...



 We are a team of engineers who want to get things done.
  


 Our open core behavioural data platform is used by data teams to drive a better understanding of their customers - the right way. The open-sourced data pipeline stack and tracking SDKs support teams to make key decisions on high quality, trusted data. We empower and actively encourage companies to own their data strategy and the data it creates. Data quality, privacy and security are our top priorities.
  


 Snowplow is a technical product, so our Engineering team is at the forefront of what we’re offering our customers and community. We have steadily grown the team over the last two years, following investment from Atlantic Bridge and MMC Ventures. Our aim through this growth has been to maintain, if not increase, our productivity from those early days. We focus on building autonomous teams of engineers who understand where they fit in the wider Engineering efforts and collaborate closely with our top team of Product Managers. That’s us in 164 words, but there is so much more we could tell you!
  


 The Opportunity...



 We’re looking for an experienced Scala Engineer to enhance and extend the capabilities of our open source data pipeline product. You’ll be solving the complex problems that come with building data pipelines that serve a wide variety of use cases. You’ll also be a key open source maintainer on our popular pipeline components and have the opportunity to make decisions that will affect our entire estate. You will be making data teams world over very happy.
  


 Our ethos is that we want the right people making the best decisions, and you can expect we’ll be asking you what you think. Our engineers take on a lot of responsibility. This includes product ownership, testing (automated wherever possible), route to live, etc. We are not micromanaged, we don’t throw our work over the fence. In learning about and taking on these responsibilities we believe we can make quicker decisions.
  


 You will be joining a wider team of 25+ remote engineers who work directly and closely with other teams in the business.. There is a huge opportunity at Snowplow to learn more about all aspects of engineering and data, from code to customers, and how to be the most productive and empowered version of you.
  


 What you’ll be doing...



 Enhancing the Snowplow data pipeline. Contributing to our open source projects and enhancing the capability of our data pipeline across AWS and GCP.
Working within the Scala ecosystem. You’ll primarily be working with purely functional Scala, along with with cats, cats-effect, fs2 and various other libraries mostly from Typelevel stack. Although you might also get a chance to explore other languages we often use such as Go or Python.
Looking after the route to live. You’ll be creating Docker images and writing the Terraform to automate the deployment process of hundreds of data pipelines.
Automation and Testing. Continue to improve our automation and testing experiences, extend our existing Github Actions CI/CD processes to make it easier to work and contribute to our projects.
Open Source. As one of Snowplow's open source maintainers, you’ll get to manage open source projects, plan and communicate our upcoming releases, engage with our users via slick documentation, create easy to understand READMEs and discuss problems with users through our forums.
Empowered. Working in a productive, empowered team. Most companies talk about the importance of this, but we’re really doing it. Come talk to us about how.



 We’d love to hear from you if...



 You have professional Scala Experience. You have experience working within the Scala ecosystem, even better if that experience is working with data or data pipelines.
You have used Cloud technologies. The Snowplow pipeline currently works on AWS and GCP, and soon Azure.


 You care about open source. You like the idea of working on open source projects and interacting with the developer community who use them.
  

You enjoy working remotely. Our remote team depends on expert collaborators to work effectively. You’ll be a great communicator and enjoy working closely with the team.
Experience working with data stacks. Previous experience in data is a plus, but most importantly you have an interest in data and how it empowers companies to make better decisions.
Security. Data security and integrity are fundamental to what we do, so you’ll need a solid understanding of security threats and how to overcome them.
Self motivated. You don’t wait to be told what to do. You can understand a problem, drive toward a solution and recognise when you need support or more direction.
Pragmatic. We can’t do everything today. You’ll be pragmatic in your approach to software delivery and balance our speed of learning with our commitment to providing a reliable and trusted service to customers.



 What you get in return for being awesome...



 A competitive package, including share options
Fantastic holiday allowance no matter where you are
Freedom to work from wherever suits you best
Cycle to work scheme if UK-based

Who we are
 At Path we believe behavioral health should be treated with the same respect, rigor, and focus of other chronic diseases. We're building the future of mental health, and in 20 years we'll look back and be astounded that we ever treated the physical before the mental.
 What we're solving
 Over 65 million Americans suffer from a treatable mental health issue - that's 1 out of every 5 people. Today it's difficult to find a provider, and for those with complicated conditions, it's nearly impossible to find coordinated care. We're here to fix this.
 How we're solving
 Path is at the intersection of tech + mental health with thousands of therapists, psychiatrists, and other mental health services delivering care through a virtual first approach. Our platform matches patients with exactly the right person for their needs, whether it's experience with a certain condition, gender, race, location, life experience, etc.

 Role Overview
 As a member of Path's Engineering team, you'll be able to focus on doing your best work and create a real impact with a team of like-minded people who waste minimal time on unnecessary overhead. While we're looking for software engineers of all levels of seniority, we're excited by candidates who enjoy and are capable of working on a small team with a fast-growing product. We're looking for generalists who can work across the stack and those who gravitate towards frontend, backend, or infrastructure engineering. We recognize people are passionate about different areas and you'll have the option to be involved in as much (or as little) as you'd like.
 Today we build products for 2 primary customers; patients and therapists:
 On the patient side, we're focused on a fast and delightful enrollment where patients can find a therapist that's right for them and who takes their insurance in less than 10 minutes.
 On the therapist side, we're building a full set of practice management software including patient recruiting, scheduling, patient notes, referrals, and more. Our therapists spend all day in Path and their experience needs to be fantastic.
 This is a really unique opportunity to help build on the foundational engineering infrastructure at a company where the business is already humming and we have thousands of users every day. If this sounds exciting and energizing, we'd love to talk!
 Technical Stack
 Path's systems are written in Ruby on Rails, with React frontends. We use Postgres for our databases and everything is hosted on AWS. We also make heavy use of existing tools like Salesforce, Airtable, Typeform, etc. This has enabled us to scale very quickly with a small team but we're now ready to bring much of this work in-house. We're standing up the technical foundation that will power the future of the company. It doesn't matter if you don't have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, we'd still love to connect with you!
 What You'll Be Doing
 As an engineer at Path, you'll have endless opportunities to help build, shape, and lay the tracks for future technical infrastructure, and provide input on product, design, and cultural decisions, if that interests you.
 In this role, you will:

Spend most of your time writing code. We are a small team with minimal overhead and you'll spend the vast majority of your day actually writing code.
Build, test, and deploy software in a continuous manner (we deploy throughout the week, if not every day)
Work across the company to shape the future of the engineering organization. We are getting started and if there's a topic you're passionate about like recruiting, deployment, infrastructure, tools, etc., we're excited for you to contribute.
Actively shape the product direction by participating in product reviews, design reviews, and customer research.
Create and contribute to technical specs and testing/rollout plans.
Work with external and internal stakeholders to ensure we're solving the right problems.
Mentor and sponsor your teammates to help them grow.

What We're Looking For
 Even if you don't have experience with the specific technologies in our stack, we'd love to talk to you! An ideal candidate would be someone with the following traits:

Self-managed work-ethic. We are building a highly focused, low overhead team and trust people to get their work done on their own initiative
Shipped customer-focused software at scale
Problem solvers, people who are going to be able to spot problems in existing systems and/or people who come with a solution-oriented approach
Working experience from a technology company or technology startup
Collaborative working style, success working across functions
Clear and concise written, verbal, and technical communication skills
Experience writing well-structured, well-tested, and maintainable code
Demonstrated ability to mentor and teach others



 Our Team
 Path is a respectful, upbeat, and remote-first team united by our mission of simplifying behavioral healthcare services. We want our employees to be themselves and celebrate each other's differences. We trust our employees to do what's best for patients and our fellow team members without bureaucracy. We prioritize self-care and are building a sustainable business for the long term.
 As Part Of Our Team, Full-Time Employees Receive

The ability to work from wherever you want within the US
Competitive pay and benefits that don't change based on your location
2 company-wide shutdown weeks each year to focus on self-care
Paid parental leave to support you and your family
Medical, dental, and vision insurance through our employer plan
Access to our 401K
Access to an Employer Assistance Plan (EAP) through our insurance plan
The equipment you need to ensure your home office sets you up for success

UNDP is committed to achieving workforce diversity in terms of gender, nationality and culture. Individuals from minority groups, indigenous groups and persons with disabilities are equally encouraged to apply. All applications will be treated with the strictest confidence.


UNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.












Background






The ACP-EU Development Minerals Programme is a capacity-building programme that aims to build the profile and improve the management of development minerals (industrial minerals; construction materials; dimension stones; and semi-precious stones). The Programme is an initiative of the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS), financed by the European Union and UNDP, and implemented by UNDP.
 Development minerals are minerals and materials that are mined, processed, manufactured and used domestically in industries such as construction, manufacturing, and agriculture. They have a high degree of economic linkage and utilization close to the location where the commodity is mined. The mining of development minerals has important implications for sustainable development. However, they have not to date received adequate attention for their potential to impact livelihoods and few development programmes have provided support for this mining sub-sector. Often referred to as Low Value Minerals and Materials (LVMM) due to their low price as a function of their weight, and their relatively low value to international commodity markets, development minerals provide crucial inputs for domestic economic development (infrastructure, manufacturing, construction and agriculture to name a few) and have the potential to be high value in terms of domestic development.
 Programme Implementation and Management
 The ACP-EU Development Minerals Programme is building the capacity of key stakeholders in the sector, including public stakeholders such as regulatory agencies and local governments; private stakeholders such as small-scale mining enterprises, intermediaries, transportation and logistics service providers, construction companies; business development stakeholders such as mining and quarrying associations, Chambers of Mines, training centres, universities, consulting companies; and social stakeholders such as civil society organizations and community groups.
 The Programme is being implemented at both regional and country levels. Regional level activities such as training will involve forty (40) countries from the 6 OACPS regions; while in-depth support at country level is being provided for 6 countries namely: Cameroon, Fiji, Guinea (Conakry), Jamaica, Uganda and Zambia. Four countries have been added to the existing focus countries to bring the total number to ten (10). Training and support will be provided in the following thematic areas of importance to the sector: 1) mine and quarry management; 2) environment, health and safety; 3) entrepreneurship skills; 4) market analysis and investment promotion; 5) geo-data and maps design; 6) community relations and addressing grievances.

The Elevator Pitch: Why will you enjoy this new opportunity?
 SDWAN was just the beginning. With SASE, we are bringing a whole new set of value-added services to our customers. Through our growing set of SASE Points-of-Presence(POPs) around the world, we have the opportunity a create and offer a whole host of new capabilities across a wide array of technologies, from 5G to security to network optimizations and more. Each of these new services further increases the value of the network for our customers and the differentiation of the VMware solution.

 This is a role in the CTO team within SEBU. We work at the forefront of these new feature offerings, partnering with customers and our SEBU engineering team to develop early prototypes and new product innovation, as well as continuing to evolve our core SDWAN and SASE offerings to utilize the latest technologies to increase scale, performance, and reliability. This is a role focused on our software data plane, responsible for new feature prototyping and development, and cross product integration written mostly in C, with some work in Python. If you’re interested in working within a small, high performance team building new and innovative networking products, this is the team you want to join.

 Success in the Role: What are the performance outcomes over the first 6-12 months you will work toward completing?

 Within one month of employment, you should expect to ramp up on the technical stacks and set up your dev environment. The projects we work on are early-stage concepts and thus challenging and fast moving, so expect to be thrown into feature development as soon as possible.
 Within six months of employment, you should expect to have developed features necessary for customer betas of the significant new features for the product. 
Within a year of employment, you should be expected to take on new feature development for the GA version of the project and drive features from design to implementation.

Familiarity with a variety of networking control plane protocols is also useful, and experience with SD-WAN or other software-defined networking technologies is helpful. We develop on bare-metal hardware as well as virtualized environments, so familiarity with ESXi and KVM is desirable, and we also deploy in all the major cloud environments (AWS, Azure, GCP), so prior experience working on cloud-based development is preferred. You will take complete ownership of your tasks end-to-end which includes design, implementation, unit testing and deployment of the product/service.

 What is the leadership like for this role? What is the structure and culture of the team like?
 The team will is a small, fast-moving advanced technologies team where you will work with other members of the SEBU CTO group, our SASE Engineering team, as well as partnering with other engineering teams across VMware, and potentially with external partners. As the team scales, you will be expected to become a domain expert in the area you own and be able to lead on the projects falling in your area of expertise. The team culture is challenging and fast paced, but with good people that are ready to help each other and support each other and be successful together. We have people from different backgrounds, and we believe a diverse team can help sparking innovation.

    At Density, we build one of the most advanced people sensing systems in the world. The product and infrastructure is nuanced and one-of-a-kind. Building this product for scale has been an exercise in patience, creativity, remarkable engineering, laser physics, global logistics, and grit. The team is thoughtful, driven, and world-class.
   


 Density systems are real-time, accurate, and anonymous by design. We help today’s largest companies understand how their buildings get used. We have counted hundreds of millions of people.
   


 Counting people in “real-time” is unique and particularly hard to achieve. It allows a user to walk into a room, beneath our sensor, and see the room’s occupancy increment 700ms later.
   


 Today alone, Density will ingest over 1m events. In the coming year, our sensor network is on track to grow ten-fold. The overall system load is exploding. Maintaining our low latency standards requires an increasingly thoughtful system.
   


 We’re architecting infrastructure where annual, unscheduled downtime is measured in minutes. We’re building intelligent redundancies so missed events are an oddity. We’re constructing an exceptional engineering team to support always-on, intelligible analytics generated on the fly.
   


 As a Backend Engineer at Density, you will be joining not only a team, but a company, that highly values you and the work you do.
   


 This role reports to our Director of Software Engineering.
    




    You can read our values here.
   



What we're looking for:

 You have 3+ years experience shaping highly scalable enterprise systems. Or can demonstrate similar proficiency. You have a command of technologies like TimescaleDB, Redis, Kafka, Postgres, AWS, Django, and Python. You have architected complex data pipelines, APIs, and data delivery mechanisms. You have had significant senior responsibility for monitoring, profiling and improving system performance. You have demonstrated the ability to navigate the nuanced needs of internal tools and customer facing systems. You can balance a demanding workload, discern priorities, and communicate tradeoffs effectively. You are resourceful, direct, helpful, driven, and mission-oriented. You have an understanding of statistical analysis and trend data modeling. You have worked with container orchestration technologies like kubernetes or nomad. You embrace the opportunity to share your knowledge. You have a working knowledge of front end technologies like ES6, React, and Redux. You have an excitement for and ability to interact directly with customers. You have an awareness of your weak spots and a genuine desire to improve. You’re looking for a long-term role with a company that has long-term ambition.





What we bring:

 A team hailing from places like Apple, LinkedIn, Stripe, Cisco Meraki, Hashi Corp, WeWork, NASA, & beyond. $227 million raised from investors like Kleiner Perkins, Founders Fund, and Upfront Ventures. A work environment full of fun, smart, talented, dedicated, and truly kind teammates. Our values are be humble, seek feedback, and always solve the fundamental problem. These values are hard to achieve but we aspire to them daily. Excellent benefits including medical, dental, vision, mental and reproductive health, 401K, equity, Flex Fridays, Remote Friendly, unlimited and mandatory PTO and more.





    We are looking for candidates who are strong in several areas and have exposure to or interest in the others. Most of all, we are looking for candidates who see themselves as a meaningful addition to Density’s team and culture.

Found is a modern weight care platform and community focused on integrated support. According to a recent CDC study, nearly 50% of Americans want to lose weight, and on average, Americans have gained 30 lbs during the pandemic.

Front End Development exists across all of Shopify, from Product to Marketing, working closely with the teams that create performant experiences and communicate Shopify’s impact on commerce to a global audience. You may also collaborate with our Data and SEO teams, helping us make data informed decisions and driving additional new merchant acquisition. You might focus on creating thoughtful interfaces for our users, shaping our design language, and contributing to our shared component libraries in a maintainable and scalable way.
 Infrastructure Are you looking for an opportunity to work on planet-scale infrastructure? Do you want your work to impact thousands of engineers and millions of customers? Do you genuinely enjoy tackling complex problems, and learning through experimentation? Shopify Production Engineering is all of this and more. The Production Engineering team builds and maintains Shopify’s critical infrastructure through software and systems engineering. We make sure Shopify—the world’s fastest growing commerce platform—is able to scale massively while staying resilient for our 2000+ development team to build on and our millions of merchants to depend on. Some of the technology that the team uses: Ruby, Rails, Go, Kubernetes, MySQL, Redis, Memcached, Docker, Distributed Systems, Google Cloud. Is some of this tech new to you? That’s OK! We know not everyone will come in fully familiar with this stack, and we provide support to learn on the job.

 You will be at the heart of New Relic’s engineering process of maintaining NerdGraph, New Relic's GraphQL API gateway. You will support, maintain, and enhance a complex, distributed back-end service, which is among New Relic’s most critical product infrastructure. You will build and maintain tooling that supports rapid API development inside New Relic without sacrificing quality.
 This is an opportunity to work on a team that values both collaboration and individual focus to solve difficult engineering problems. We support each other to do our best work through positive communication and continuous improvement. We care about fostering a sense of community and fun. We are a team that cares about and invests in the growth of early career software engineers. We believe our journey together is just as important as the outcomes we achieve.
 As a Software Engineer on the Unified API Team, you will:

 Contribute improvements to our team processes
 Collaborate across functions and teams to bring the best solution to market
 Participate in an internal support rotation to help other engineers at New Relic troubleshoot their use of our services

 About the Work:
 The character of our team’s work requires us to be thoughtful, thorough, and meticulous as we debug, support, and expand one of New Relic’s most complex and critical systems. Our time is often split between thinking about the “big picture” that impacts dozens of other services and the nitty gritty details of well crafted code. The work can be challenging, but it’s also fun. While the system may be complex, we’re proud of our codebase as well as the work we’ve done to keep operational burden low.
 If this sounds intimidating, be assured that we greatly value mentorship and our strong, experienced team will guide and support you. The important part is that this kind of challenge sounds enjoyable!

 2+ years of software engineering experience
 An interest or experience in GraphQL and believe in the importance of good API design
 You are excited to learn and use Elixir, and gain expertise in functional programming
 You are comfortable shipping incrementally and often
 You are comfortable working on a distributed team. You communicate clearly in writing and over video conference
 You care about improving human processes as much as improving code
 You are curious and enjoy learning by digging into a complex system (both independently and with support)

 Nice to Haves:

 Experience using Elixir or other functional languages (Elm, Haskell, Scala, etc)
 Experience building and scaling resilient high throughput services
 Experience designing GraphQL APIs
 Experience working in systems composed of many distinct services or applications working in concert (aka “Service Oriented Architectures”)

About UsAt Close, we're building the sales communication platform of the future. With our roots as the very first sales CRM to include built-in calling, we're leading the industry toward eliminating manual processes and helping companies to close more deals (faster). Since our founding in 2013, we've grown to become a profitable, 100% globally distributed team of ~55 high-performing, happy people that are dedicated to building a product our customers love.
Our app’s frontend is a single-page JavaScript web app mostly written in React (originally built with Backbone.js). We bundle with Webpack and target only modern browsers. We test with Jest and React Testing Library. Our UI updates in near real-time and is written in LESS/CSS (with flexbox and grid layout) using CSS modules and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets and WebRTC.
We care about performance (e.g. route-based code splitting), maintainability, and testability of our frontend code. We sweat the UI/UX details and work collaboratively with the Product team throughout the design process. This means diving into lo-fi wireframes, and communicating continuously when those ideas are brought to life using Figma and code.
Our frontend app is built on top of our REST API & GraphQL endpoints. Our backend tech stack consists of Python/Flask, MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. We run our services in Docker on AWS.
We ❤️ open sourcing our code and ideas on our GitHub and on The Making of Close, our behind-the-scenes Product & Engineering blog. Check our projects such as react-custom-scroller, use-infinite-scroll, use-abortable-effect, and smart-tooltip-delay or insights from our day-to-day work on such as Highlights From a Complex Downshift.js Refactor, A Case Study in"Reactizing" a Complex Backbone View, and Finding the cause of a memory leak in Jest tests.
*About You*We're looking for an experienced full-time Frontend Engineering Manager to join our engineering team. You should be an empathetic leader, have spent part of your career as a senior-level engineer, and want to help build & grow a team of high-performing engineers.
You should have senior-level (4 years+) experience building modern frontend applications, preferably using React or similar framework.
You should have significant experience (2 years+) leading and growing a team of engineers. You enjoy helping engineers thrive and grow in their roles. You should have a very good idea of how to run 1:1s with your direct reports and how to form strong relationships. You should be comfortable with giving continuous feedback and doing performance reviews. You are expected to grow the team as-needed and help lead a hiring process.
You have a track record of managing engineering teams that delivered great products and features. You should be very comfortable working with the Product and Design teams to formulate product ideas, skilled at writing & reviewing technical specifications, and planning work for your team. You can take on non-critical path technical work if time allows.
You’re comfortable working in a fast-paced environment with a medium-sized talented team where you're supported in your efforts to grow professionally. You are able to manage your time well, communicate effectively, and collaborate in a fully distributed team.
You are located in an American time zone.
Bonus points if you have...

Experience practicing the Shape Up product development methodology
Experience scaling a small engineering team into a few teams
Experience building JS-based mobile apps
Built B2B SaaS products
Experience with sales or sales tools

About the Role

Manage and grow a team of 4-8 high-performing engineers, support them through 1:1s and continuous feedback, and support their career growth.
A mix of team leadership, people management, product ideation, project coordination, and maximum 10% of your time spent on non-critical path IC work.

About Us
 Proton.ai is revolutionizing wholesale distribution. Distributors sell nearly every physical good you come across. Key to the economy, they make up over 28% of GDP. But there's a problem. Selling as a distributor is complicated. They carry hundreds of thousands of complicated products, making it impossible for sales teams to know what their customers need. Proton cuts through this complexity with machine learning. We provide a solution that modernizes distributors' sales efforts. And in doing so, we help distributors better serve their customers and grow.
 Our company is in hyper-growth mode. We've had significant year-over-year revenue growth, and we just raised a $20M Series A backed by Felicis Ventures (investors in Twitch, Shopify, Opendoor, and many others) and Battery Ventures. Needless to say, it's an exciting time to join the Proton.ai team.
 The Role
 At Proton, we're bringing cutting-edge machine learning to B2B distribution. By predicting what customers will buy, we're improving sales and efficiency, and driving growth. Of course, we have to do this in a smart, scalable way, and take steps not to overload the user with data. Our goal is to make things easier for our users to be effective with minimal effort on their part, not to create a new Excel.
 As a Backend Engineer, you'll work with our Python and Go code to improve the workflows of distribution sales reps. You'll have access to our growing backend group across the company, working across our different products. You'll also have access to actual users to workshop your features, too.
 We're looking for someone high-potential we can build, nurture, and support in their career, and take along for an exciting startup adventure.
 This is a full-time, fully-remote position, with occasional paid travel to in-person meetups. It includes a salary of $110,000 to $155,000 (US, depending on level). For this hire, we are looking for someone located in the Americas who is willing to commit to working permanently on a US timezone.
 What you'll do:

Work with UX designers, product managers, and frontend engineers to help devise, design, build, and revise new features. 
You'll achieve this through collaborating with your team to deliver a seamless, performant experience across the web and mobile device 
Collaborate with data scientists to deliver thoughtful features powered by cutting-edge machine learning models. 

Experience that may be helpful:

Our backend code is written in Python and Go, deployed using a microservice architecture 
You will need some familiarity with big data and deploying scalable and tested code, but specific knowledge of Python or Go is not required 

Benefits

Competitive Salaries + Company Stock Options - we want to pay you well (and equitably!) and make you feel like an owner.
Flexible Schedule - we think high levels of autonomy, responsibility and working asynchronously foster an amazing workplace.
Unlimited PTO + 10 Company Paid Holidays - we even have tools implemented to detect burnout to make sure folks recharge regularly.
401k with Employer Contribution (US only, for now!) - we know work isn't forever, so we contribute up to 3% of your salary to help you prepare whether you directly contribute or not.
Medical, Dental, and Vision Insurance - we cover one medical plan 100% in the USA and cover a premium plan 100% for international employees (for US- this includes a HSA!) and cover 50% for dependents on all our medical plan options.
$450 Quarterly Remote Working Stipend - to iterate and upgrade your WFH setup, cover cell phone/internet bills or even to go towards Coworking space!
12 Weeks Fully Paid Parental Leave - that goes for primary and secondary caregivers; even if you're adopting or fostering!
Biannual Company Paid off-sites - time for us to be together, brainstorm, and make magic happen.

Our Hiring Process
 As you may have noticed, our hiring process is a little different. At Proton.ai, we assess candidates using an unbiased and thoughtful process. We ask questions directly related to the work you will be doing. Resumes are optional. They are not the focus of our selection process.
 You can read more about that — and learn more about our engineering organization more generally — on our engineering blog.

Company Description  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

You will have the opportunity to work on a wide range of high-impact projects including experimentation solutions, identity resolution, privacy law compliance, conversion optimization, site performance monitoring and optimization, insights and analytics, and data monitoring pipelines.
 Prior marketing technology experience is not required, but one should be excited to learn the art and science of Digital Marketing.

 Solve complex architecture and business problems; your solutions are extensible and you work to simplify, optimize, and remove bottlenecks
 Design and code; your solutions yield significant performance, availability, and business value

 Enjoy solving cross-functional problems and working collaboratively

 1+ years of experience contributing to the system design or architecture (architecture, design patterns, reliability, and scaling) of new and current systems
 3+ years of industry experience with the ability to work across the entire software stack.
 Experience with Infrastructure as Code and in automated delivery of code and infrastructure via the development of CICD pipelines
 Experience working with containerization technologies using Kubernetes, Docker, or AWS ECS

We are indispensable in helping them to pass on orders, draw up inventories, calculate food costs, display allergens and so on!
    

 You are a software all-rounder who loves to work on web and mobile technologies. All you need is some great coffee, a group of talented colleagues and a whiteboard to design the blueprint of our next software module. You are not afraid of getting your hands dirty to find that one obnoxious bug that no one else could track down. You sometimes wonder how people ever got things done without Stack Overflow, but you take pride in improving those suggestions and adapting them to the current context.

 What you'll be doing 



       You'll work on the software that powers apicbase.com by writing Python (Django) and Javascript code (Vue JS).
      


        You'll join and contribute to team meetings where we design the blueprint for the future (and sometimes the past, in case of refactorings) of Apicbase.
      


        You'll become part of a team of talented colleagues adopting lean methodology with great support for our Product Owners, Tech Team Leads and Quality Engineers.
      


        All over apicbase.com there will be bits and pieces of code highlighting your unique strengths and skills.

          Python and/or Django experience
        


          Experience writing web apps using web frameworks (Laravel, Django, Angular, ...)
        


          Experience with continuous deployment pipelines
        


          HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript/Vue
        



        You have a feeling for efficiency when writing database queries or more complex algorithms.
      


        When you stumble upon code in need of a small refactoring you'll not hesitate and just do what needs to be done
      


        You're not the 'but it works on my machine...' type of guy/girl
      




What do we offer? 




       A full time and ultra-varied job at a well-funded, successful and fast-growing scale-up
      


        Working in a company-culture with ownership, self-responsibility and accountability

Semantic (highly readable)
Performance-oriented (think DRY and KISS)

JOB RESPONSIBILITIES

Build and support WordPress websites, using both custom and pre-built themes
Handle incoming client support requests by email, chat, and (less often) phone
Assist back-end developers with components of larger and/or non-WordPress projects

REQUIRED SKILLS

In-depth experience using Advanced Custom Fields
Excellent verbal and written communication skills
