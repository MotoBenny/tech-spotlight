Company Description  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely – and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, we’re a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.


  Job Description
   Merchants hire the Help Experience Team to provide them the right solutions at the right time to ensure they continue to be successful with their business.
 As a software engineer on this team, you'll be a part of evolving our support products for Square's millions of merchants. We leverage experimentation, personalization, recommendation relevancy, and more to ensure that we route sellers to the right help experiences at the right time according to their unique needs. We must do this with technical sustainability and scale in mind for our merchants and teams at Square to benefit from our work.



  Qualifications
   You will...

 Be exposed to and impact real business challenges.
 Identify and explore ways to improve application architecture, testing, and building pipeline.
 Continually seek to optimize and improve the seller experience.
 Iterate rapidly on features, tooling, and processes.
 Provide technical leadership, mentor and coach junior engineers.

 You’ll need to…

 Be proficient in building web apps and large-scale applications.
 Build with modern front-end and server-side technologies and frameworks

Job Type: Full-time


About Us
 Proton.ai is revolutionizing wholesale distribution. Distributors sell nearly every physical good you come across. Key to the economy, they make up over 28% of GDP. But there's a problem. Selling as a distributor is complicated. They carry hundreds of thousands of complicated products, making it impossible for sales teams to know what their customers need. Proton cuts through this complexity with machine learning. We provide a solution that modernizes distributors' sales efforts. And in doing so, we help distributors better serve their customers and grow.
 Our company is in hyper-growth mode. We've had significant year-over-year revenue growth, and we just raised a $20M Series A backed by Felicis Ventures (investors in Twitch, Shopify, Opendoor, and many others) and Battery Ventures. Needless to say, it's an exciting time to join the Proton.ai team.
 The Role
 At Proton, we're bringing cutting-edge machine learning to B2B distribution. By predicting what customers will buy, we're improving sales and efficiency, and driving growth. Of course, we have to do this in a smart, scalable way, and take steps not to overload the user with data. Our goal is to make things easier for our users to be effective with minimal effort on their part, not to create a new Excel.
 As a Backend Engineer, you'll work with our Python and Go code to improve the workflows of distribution sales reps. You'll have access to our growing backend group across the company, working across our different products. You'll also have access to actual users to workshop your features, too.
 We're looking for someone high-potential we can build, nurture, and support in their career, and take along for an exciting startup adventure.
 This is a full-time, fully-remote position, with occasional paid travel to in-person meetups. It includes a salary of $110,000 to $155,000 (US, depending on level). For this hire, we are looking for someone located in the Americas who is willing to commit to working permanently on a US timezone.
 What you'll do:

Work with UX designers, product managers, and frontend engineers to help devise, design, build, and revise new features. 
You'll achieve this through collaborating with your team to deliver a seamless, performant experience across the web and mobile device 
Collaborate with data scientists to deliver thoughtful features powered by cutting-edge machine learning models. 

Experience that may be helpful:

Our backend code is written in Python and Go, deployed using a microservice architecture 
You will need some familiarity with big data and deploying scalable and tested code, but specific knowledge of Python or Go is not required 

Benefits

Competitive Salaries + Company Stock Options - we want to pay you well (and equitably!) and make you feel like an owner.
Flexible Schedule - we think high levels of autonomy, responsibility and working asynchronously foster an amazing workplace.
Unlimited PTO + 10 Company Paid Holidays - we even have tools implemented to detect burnout to make sure folks recharge regularly.
401k with Employer Contribution (US only, for now!) - we know work isn't forever, so we contribute up to 3% of your salary to help you prepare whether you directly contribute or not.
Medical, Dental, and Vision Insurance - we cover one medical plan 100% in the USA and cover a premium plan 100% for international employees (for US- this includes a HSA!) and cover 50% for dependents on all our medical plan options.
$450 Quarterly Remote Working Stipend - to iterate and upgrade your WFH setup, cover cell phone/internet bills or even to go towards Coworking space!
12 Weeks Fully Paid Parental Leave - that goes for primary and secondary caregivers; even if you're adopting or fostering!
Biannual Company Paid off-sites - time for us to be together, brainstorm, and make magic happen.

Our Hiring Process
 As you may have noticed, our hiring process is a little different. At Proton.ai, we assess candidates using an unbiased and thoughtful process. We ask questions directly related to the work you will be doing. Resumes are optional. They are not the focus of our selection process.

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) at Benchling is also part of the Infrastructure team. We empower engineers on other teams by making their work easier. As the Benchling engineering team triples in size, we’ll invest in our service architecture, monitoring. tooling, and site reliability processes so we can build the next generation of our product. Our users are generating more kinds of data at an increasing rate and they’re collaborating globally with each other, so our infrastructure needs to grow alongside them. In addition, the data our customers entrust us with is key to their businesses, so our platform needs to be highly reliable and trusted.
As a platform, Benchling is also a developer-facing product where we enable new forms of automation and integration in the life science space. Your work will be used more directly here - Benchling infrastructure extends or replaces our customers’ infrastructure to store/process data. You may build systems that form a data pipeline for experimental results, an event queue to trigger customer integrations, or a compute platform to deploy and scale custom analysis.
We are looking for strong engineers with 5+ years of experience to join as a member of the larger Platform team and work alongside other infrastructure-focused peers. You’ll collaborate with former Stripe, Google, and Facebook engineers to build a highly reliable, yet rapidly-evolving, backbone of our platform.
If you are to graduate with your Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in class of 2021-2022, please consider applying to our Software Engineer, New Graduate position here.
WHAT YOU MIGHT WORK ON

Design, build, and maintain core infrastructure hosted on AWS
Build developer-facing systems to test, build, and deploy Benchling’s software
Define and implement our infrastructural security posture
Develop monitoring/observability and automation as part of a lean operations function
Define and lead processes for site reliability that will be used across Engineering and Customer Experience
These are examples of projects we’ve worked on in the past or may work on in the near future - our projects are often changing, but this will hopefully give you an idea of the work to be done.
Iterating on our tenancy model and architecture to build out resource isolation, data segmentation, and deployment models as we scale our customer base.
Building a test and deploy pipeline on Buildkite - we have a large test suite and a large number of Benchling instances and need tools to deploy faster while maintaining the same degree of reliability.
Improving network performance for global users - this is an open-ended problem which needs to be solved as our user base becomes increasingly international.
Observability - mature our monitoring, tracing, and alerting systems so we have the right dashboards, notifications, and tools to quickly identify and resolve operational issues.
Automating remediation of fault conditions to improve overall reliability and eliminate repetitive operational tasks.
Building tooling and infrastructure for a more modular/service-based architecture - we’re not religious about microservices or monoliths, but we plan to scale our architecture with our engineering team.

ABOUT YOU

5+ more years of experience as a DevOps engineer, Site Reliability engineer, or Software Engineer building platform infrastructure.
Have experience with deployment and configuration management frameworks such as Terraform, Ansible, or Chef; with CI/CD systems such as BuildKite or Jenkins; and with containers and container management systems such as Kubernetes or Amazon ECS.
Understand cloud computing, virtualization, and microservices architectures. Experience with major cloud platforms, especially AWS, is a plus.

Company Description  Since we first opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely â€“ and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take a payment and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldnâ€™t work together. So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions â€“ to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, run a busy kitchen, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. And across it all, weâ€™ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow all in one place.  Today, weâ€™re a partner to sellers of all sizes â€“ large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex commerce operations, sellers just starting out, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers scale, so do our solutions. We all grow together.   There is a massive opportunity in front of us. Weâ€™re building a business that is big, meaningful, and lasting. And we are helping sellers around the world do the same.

We leverage experimentation, personalization, recommendation relevancy, and more to ensure that we route sellers to the right help experiences at the right time according to their unique needs. We must do this with technical sustainability and scale in mind for our merchants and teams at Square to benefit from our work.

Youâ€™ll make improvements to our data pipeline, infrastructure and tools to improve our data processing capabilities for all of our customers. Youâ€™ll participate in and contribute to Agile team activities. Youâ€™ll triage work assigned to the team, ensure itâ€™s ready to be worked on, and estimate the level of effort. Youâ€™ll apply Kyruusâ€™ software engineering best practices, coding standards and patterns for development and deployment. Youâ€™ll investigate alerts about possible errors in our system. Youâ€™ll help solve outages, participate in retrospectives, and implement countermeasures to prevent similar issues from recurring. Youâ€™ll create tools and documentation for internal teams like Delivery to understand how our systems work and to enable them to onboard customers in a timely manner with minimal support from Engineering. Youâ€™ll report to the Senior Manager, Engineering in the Customer Onboarding Department within the R&D - Engineering Division.





Respect

 How Youâ€™ll Use Your Professional Skills Youâ€™ll use your entry level experience (1+ years) and/or education in programming to: Help the Agile team execute on internal and external commitments on time. Youâ€™ll use your experience in/familiarity with technologies relevant to Kyruus to: Build, scale, and deliver dynamic and highly-available enterprise solutions.

Empowerment

 How Youâ€™ll Know Youâ€™re Succeeding You enjoy coding and deliver high-quality, robustly coded, easy-to-reason-about software with your proficiency in Python and ability to use data manipulation tools like JMESPath. You complete your tasks reliably and on time to help the team achieve roadmap goals and customer commits. You test your changes thoroughly to ensure that your solution meets the acceptance criteria and does not introduce bugs. You ask for help when youâ€™re blocked and invest in learning from mentors and seek training opportunities to improve your skills as a software engineer. You are assigned tasks of increasing levels of complexity that youâ€™re able to complete with growing confidence. You contribute to improving your teamâ€™s software development and deployment processes and are able to demonstrate a high degree of predictability and accountability in delivering your work. Where Youâ€™ll Go From Here Kyruuvians in the Software Engineer I role can move in a linear career path to a Software Engineer II or based on skills, performance, and results accomplished to Senior Software Engineer I position. From the Senior Software Engineer position, you can choose to develop along one of two tracks - individual contributor, as a Principal Software Engineer I, or management, as a Manager, Engineering. Kyruus also loves to see an internal transfer. If a linear career path is not what youâ€™re looking for, you can work with your manager and HR to explore lateral moves to other parts of the organization as you continue to grow with us.

Job Type: Full-time


About Us
 Proton.ai is revolutionizing wholesale distribution. Distributors sell nearly every physical good you come across. Key to the economy, they make up over 28% of GDP. But there's a problem. Selling as a distributor is complicated. They carry hundreds of thousands of complicated products, making it impossible for sales teams to know what their customers need. Proton cuts through this complexity with machine learning. We provide a solution that modernizes distributors' sales efforts. And in doing so, we help distributors better serve their customers and grow.
 Our company is in hyper-growth mode. We've had significant year-over-year revenue growth, and we just raised a $20M Series A backed by Felicis Ventures (investors in Twitch, Shopify, Opendoor, and many others) and Battery Ventures. Needless to say, it's an exciting time to join the Proton.ai team.
 The Role
 At Proton, we're bringing cutting-edge machine learning to B2B distribution. By predicting what customers will buy, we're improving sales and efficiency, and driving growth. Of course, we have to do this in a smart, scalable way, and take steps not to overload the user with data. Our goal is to make things easier for our users to be effective with minimal effort on their part, not to create a new Excel.
 As a Backend Engineer, you'll work with our Python and Go code to improve the workflows of distribution sales reps. You'll have access to our growing backend group across the company, working across our different products. You'll also have access to actual users to workshop your features, too.
 We're looking for someone high-potential we can build, nurture, and support in their career, and take along for an exciting startup adventure.
 This is a full-time, fully-remote position, with occasional paid travel to in-person meetups. It includes a salary of $110,000 to $155,000 (US, depending on level). For this hire, we are looking for someone located in the Americas who is willing to commit to working permanently on a US timezone.
 What you'll do:

Work with UX designers, product managers, and frontend engineers to help devise, design, build, and revise new features. 
You'll achieve this through collaborating with your team to deliver a seamless, performant experience across the web and mobile device 
Collaborate with data scientists to deliver thoughtful features powered by cutting-edge machine learning models. 

Experience that may be helpful:

Our backend code is written in Python and Go, deployed using a microservice architecture 
You will need some familiarity with big data and deploying scalable and tested code, but specific knowledge of Python or Go is not required 

Benefits

Competitive Salaries + Company Stock Options - we want to pay you well (and equitably!) and make you feel like an owner.
Flexible Schedule - we think high levels of autonomy, responsibility and working asynchronously foster an amazing workplace.
Unlimited PTO + 10 Company Paid Holidays - we even have tools implemented to detect burnout to make sure folks recharge regularly.
401k with Employer Contribution (US only, for now!) - we know work isn't forever, so we contribute up to 3% of your salary to help you prepare whether you directly contribute or not.
Medical, Dental, and Vision Insurance - we cover one medical plan 100% in the USA and cover a premium plan 100% for international employees (for US- this includes a HSA!) and cover 50% for dependents on all our medical plan options.
$450 Quarterly Remote Working Stipend - to iterate and upgrade your WFH setup, cover cell phone/internet bills or even to go towards Coworking space!
12 Weeks Fully Paid Parental Leave - that goes for primary and secondary caregivers; even if you're adopting or fostering!
Biannual Company Paid off-sites - time for us to be together, brainstorm, and make magic happen.

Our Hiring Process
 As you may have noticed, our hiring process is a little different. At Proton.ai, we assess candidates using an unbiased and thoughtful process. We ask questions directly related to the work you will be doing. Resumes are optional. They are not the focus of our selection process.
 You can read more about that â€” and learn more about our engineering organization more generally â€” on our engineering blog.

Over the coming years, biotech will fundamentally rewrite the way we live. Gene editing and cell therapy are dramatically changing how we treat cancer and other major illnesses. Biofuels and biomaterials are transforming the cars we drive, the clothes we wear, and the makeup of everyday objects. Crop science and synthetic biology are producing sustainable and ethical food. Benchlingâ€™s mission is to accelerate the research that propels us towards this reality, and magnify its impact, through modern software.
Every day, scientists around the world use Benchlingâ€™s applications, platform, & analytics in their efforts to solve humanityâ€™s most pressing problems. For these scientists, Benchling is the central technology they use to conduct their research. Our customers include pharmaceutical giants, leading biotechs, and the worldâ€™s most renowned research institutes.
ROLE OVERVIEW
Benchling brings best-in-breed data infrastructure to the worldâ€™s leading biotech companies. As an Infrastructure Engineer, youâ€™ll build the processes and underlying systems that power Benchlingâ€™s platform and applications. Ultimately, your work will be reflected in the agility, performance, reliability, and security of the Benchling platform.
Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) at Benchling is also part of the Infrastructure team. We empower engineers on other teams by making their work easier. As the Benchling engineering team triples in size, weâ€™ll invest in our service architecture, monitoring. tooling, and site reliability processes so we can build the next generation of our product. Our users are generating more kinds of data at an increasing rate and theyâ€™re collaborating globally with each other, so our infrastructure needs to grow alongside them. In addition, the data our customers entrust us with is key to their businesses, so our platform needs to be highly reliable and trusted.
As a platform, Benchling is also a developer-facing product where we enable new forms of automation and integration in the life science space. Your work will be used more directly here - Benchling infrastructure extends or replaces our customersâ€™ infrastructure to store/process data. You may build systems that form a data pipeline for experimental results, an event queue to trigger customer integrations, or a compute platform to deploy and scale custom analysis.
We are looking for strong engineers with 5+ years of experience to join as a member of the larger Platform team and work alongside other infrastructure-focused peers. Youâ€™ll collaborate with former Stripe, Google, and Facebook engineers to build a highly reliable, yet rapidly-evolving, backbone of our platform.
If you are to graduate with your Bachelorâ€™s or Masterâ€™s degree in class of 2021-2022, please consider applying to our Software Engineer, New Graduate position here.
WHAT YOU MIGHT WORK ON

Design, build, and maintain core infrastructure hosted on AWS
Build developer-facing systems to test, build, and deploy Benchlingâ€™s software
Define and implement our infrastructural security posture
Develop monitoring/observability and automation as part of a lean operations function
Define and lead processes for site reliability that will be used across Engineering and Customer Experience
These are examples of projects weâ€™ve worked on in the past or may work on in the near future - our projects are often changing, but this will hopefully give you an idea of the work to be done.
Iterating on our tenancy model and architecture to build out resource isolation, data segmentation, and deployment models as we scale our customer base.
Building a test and deploy pipeline on Buildkite - we have a large test suite and a large number of Benchling instances and need tools to deploy faster while maintaining the same degree of reliability.
Improving network performance for global users - this is an open-ended problem which needs to be solved as our user base becomes increasingly international.
Observability - mature our monitoring, tracing, and alerting systems so we have the right dashboards, notifications, and tools to quickly identify and resolve operational issues.
Automating remediation of fault conditions to improve overall reliability and eliminate repetitive operational tasks.
Building tooling and infrastructure for a more modular/service-based architecture - weâ€™re not religious about microservices or monoliths, but we plan to scale our architecture with our engineering team.

ABOUT YOU

5+ more years of experience as a DevOps engineer, Site Reliability engineer, or Software Engineer building platform infrastructure.
Have experience with deployment and configuration management frameworks such as Terraform, Ansible, or Chef; with CI/CD systems such as BuildKite or Jenkins; and with containers and container management systems such as Kubernetes or Amazon ECS.
